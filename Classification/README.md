In this section we introduce different classification model we created for Natural Language Processing

We create a deep learning classification model developed by pytorch
this model classify the social media text to find live kidney doner related message the model is trained 
on Twitter, Reddit, Youtube and New Yourk Time comments

How we cann use the model is explained by examples on Deployment.ipynb notebook

How load the data?



How load the a trained model?

# we saved the model under the bin folder with .pth extention
# you can save the folder in any location we saved under bin folder

How do run the model in Evaqluation mode?

# Use DeployModel class 
# there is a function named load_model
# in this function there is parameter named mode
# we can padd 'eval' to this parameter to do evaluation
# !Note : if we are in evaluation we need to have target column in data to do the evaluation
# !Note : the data we load should have a column name 'class' other wise we cannot evaluate
# to calculate the f1-score and see the train-eval-test result of the model we can use draw_performance function
# this function will render a csv file named 'result.csv' generated by the model
# to get the performance of model on the data we load need to call function get_model_performance

How do run the model in Prediction mode?

# Use DeployModel class 
# there is a function named load_model
# in this function there is parameter named mode
# we can padd 'pred' to this parameter to do evaluation
