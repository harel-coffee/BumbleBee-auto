0,11435808,Continuous EEG monitoring in a patient with massive carbamazepine overdose.,"The authors report a woman who took a massive overdose (OD) of carbamazepine (CBZ). On admission she was unconscious with absent brainstem reflexes and multifocal stimulus-sensitive myoclonus. Continuous EEG recordings showed a burst-suppression pattern with bursts containing only generalized spikes accompanying myoclonic activity. Myoclonus and EEG bursts were both spontaneous and stimulus induced. With treatment, the serum CBZ concentration declined, and the EEG became more continuous and rhythmic without epileptiform discharges. Unfortunately, the patient died from adult respiratory distress syndrome. Autopsy revealed that cortical and subcortical structures were normal without neuronal necrosis or eosinophilia. Massive CBZ OD may produce a reversible encephalopathy that includes cortical hyperexcitability, a profound burst-suppression EEG pattern, and cranial nerve areflexia. Continuous EEG monitoring is helpful in managing seizures that occur as a complication of CBZ OD, after the course of recovery or worsening, and in providing assistance with prognosis.",2001,3
1,11487721,A rare case of advanced ovarian carcinoma who developed difficulty walking 25 days after treatment with weekly paclitaxel.,"Although taxol has shown significant activity in advanced ovarian cancer, peripheral neuropathy is likely to become the major dose-limiting toxicity. We describe a case of advanced ovarian carcinoma who developed difficulty walking because of marked pain in the lower extremities and loss of proprioception 25 days after treatment with weekly taxol (80 mg/m(2)x3).",2001,8
2,11506739,Myasthenia gravis during low-dose IFN-alpha therapy for chronic hepatitis C.,"We describe the case of a 56-year-old man who had high aminotransferase levels and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies. He underwent liver biopsy and biochemical screening to evaluate whether he would benefit from interferon (IFN) treatment. The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of HCV-related active chronic hepatitis, skin porphyria, and type 2 diabetes. On December 5, 1995, he began therapy with recombinant IFN-alpha at a dose of 3 MIU three times a week. He stopped this therapy in February 1996 because of asthenia, diplopia, headache, and anxiety. During IFN therapy, he had normal aminotransferase levels and no detectable HCV RNA, a condition that persists to the present. Between March and May 1996, the patient was admitted several times to a neurology clinic, where myasthenia gravis was diagnosed and treatment with pyridostigmine and cyclosporine was initiated. This case and others indicate that caution should be exercised in administering IFN because low doses can be correlated with myasthenia gravis in patients without malignancies.",2001,7
