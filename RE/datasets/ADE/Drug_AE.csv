0,10030778,Intravenous azithromycin-induced ototoxicity.,"Intravenous azithromycin is increasingly administered for treatment of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Macrolide antibiotics cause ototoxicity, which occurs most frequently when high serum concentrations are achieved. Current dosing guidelines for intravenous azithromycin can result in much higher serum concentrations than is seen with oral administration. We describe a 47-year-old woman who developed complete deafness after receiving 8 days of intravenous azithromycin.",1999,2
3,10048291,Unaccountable severe hypercalcemia in a patient treated for hypoparathyroidism with dihydrotachysterol.,"This report describes a forty-seven-year-old female patient with a complex medical history. She was suffering from an unspecified interstitial lung disease, papillary thyroid carcinoma which had been treated, hypoparathyroidism after thyroidectomy for which she was receiving dihydrotachysterol and calcium, and atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure as a result of mitral stenosis. Shortly after mitral valve replacement she developed a severe hypercalcemia (serum calcium 5.95 mmol/l) during a febrile illness. At that time anti-tuberculous agents were also being administered for presumed tuberculosis. The possible mechanisms for this severe elevation of the calcium level are discussed. Immobilization, while Paget's bone disease was present, and perhaps enhanced activation of dihydrotachysterol by rifampicin, could have led to increased calcium-release into the circulation. Continuous supplecation of calcium and vitamin D, provoked dehydration and the mechanism of the milk-alkali syndrome also contributed to this extremely high calcium level. It is concluded that hypoparathyroid patients being treated with vitamin D and calcium should be carefully monitored in the case of an intercurrent illness or a change in medication.",1999,1
4,10082597,Pseudoporphyria induced by propionic acid derivatives.,"Pseudoporphyria is a photosensitive bullous skin disease that is distinguished from porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) by its normal porphyrin profile. Drugs are a major cause of this disease, and the list of culprits is continually expanding. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs), especially naproxen and other propionic acid derivatives, appear to be the most common offenders.
The study was carried out to increase awareness about the etiology and characteristic features of pseudoporphyria.
We report two cases of pseudoporphyria caused by naproxen and oxaprozin. We review the current English language literature on this entity and discuss its clinical features, histology, ultrastructure, etiology, and pathophysiology.
A 44-year-old man taking naproxen for chronic low back pain and a 20-year-old woman on oxaprozin for rheumatoid arthritis presented with tense bullae and cutaneous fragility on the face and the back of the hands. In both, skin biopsy showed a cell-poor subepidermal vesicle with festooning of the dermal papillae. Direct immunofluorescence revealed staining at the dermal-epidermal junction and around blood vessels with IgG in the first case and with IgG, IgA, and fibrin in the second case. Urine collections and serum samples yielded normal levels of uro- and coproporphyrins.
Most cases of pseudoporphyria are drug-induced. Naproxen, the most common offender, has been associated with a dimorphic clinical pattern: a PCT-like presentation and one simulating erythropoietic protoporphyria in the pediatric population. Other NSAIDs of the propionic acid family can also cause pseudoporphyria.",1999,1
5,10084639,Olanzapine treatment after clozapine-induced granulocytopenia in 3 patients.,"How to best treat psychotic patients who have had past clozapine-induced agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia remains a problem.
We report 3 patients with chronic schizophrenia who had previously stopped clozapine due to hematologic side effects. The patients evidenced improvement with olanzapine that equated to 16- to 31-point decreases in rating scale scores during 1-year follow-up without any hematologic abnormalities.
The results suggest that olanzapine may be useful in treating patients with clozapine-induced granulocytopenia without the risk of recurrence of hematologic side effects.",1999,2
6,10099659,Prolonged severe 5-fluorouracil-associated neurotoxicity in a patient with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency.,"5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an analogue of pyrimidine nucleosides that is widely used in the treatment of head and neck, breast, ovarian, and colon cancer. Stomatitis, diarrhea, dermatitis, and myelosuppression are the main toxicities of 5-FU. A less frequent side effect that is becoming more recognized is neurologic toxicity. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of 5-FU. DPD deficiency follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, and its prevalence is estimated to be 3%. Cancer patients who are receiving 5-FU treatment and are DPD deficient can develop severe side effects. The neurologic toxicity can vary from being mild to severe and prolonged. We describe the side effects of 5-FU in a colon cancer patient who suffered severe mucositis, desquamating dermatitis, prolonged myelosuppression, and neurologic toxicity that required admission to the intensive care unit. The patient remained hospitalized for 3 months. Recovery from the side effects was complete 4 months after the last 5-FU treatment. Subsequent testing revealed that this patient has an extremely low level of DPD activity (0.015 nmol/min/mg protein; mean, 0.189 nmol/min/mg protein). Because neurologic toxicity is becoming more recognized and DPD affects the catabolism of 5-FU, we discuss management issues and the use of new DPD inhibitors. We also discuss whether screening for DPD deficiency is warranted to identify patients at risk for severe toxicities from 5-FU treatment.",1999,0
7,10102531,Behenoyl cytarabine-associated reversible encephalopathy in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia.,"We report a case of reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a 16-year-old girl with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), who is undergoing during consolidation chemotherapy composed of BH-AC (N4-behenoyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl cytosine) and idarubicin. On the 6th day of chemotherapy, she was in a drowsy state following generalized tonic clonic seizure lasting 20 minutes. MR images revealed extensive cortical and subcortical white matter brain edema. Alertness returned over the 24 hr following by the discontinuation of BH-AC and intravenous administration of diphenylhydantoin, although she complained of intermittent headaches and visual disturbance. She gradually recovered from these symptoms during subsequent 7 days. Previously noted abnormal signal intensities have nearly disappreared on follow-up MRI obtained on the 22nd day after the first seizure. She was discharged without any neurologic sequela. This case suggests that BH-AC, a derivative of cytosine arabinoside (1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine) could be a cause of reversible encephalopathy syndrome.",1999,2
8,10190739,Acute hepatitis after riluzole administration.,"Riluzole is a new drug representing the first active treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We report the cases of two patients who developed acute hepatitis after taking riluzole at the recommended dose (100 mg daily) for 7 and 4 weeks, respectively. In both cases, liver histology showed hepatocellular damage with inflammatory infiltration and microvesicular steatosis without fibrosis. Liver enzymes returned to normal 4 and 8 weeks, respectively, after riluzole withdrawal. In one case, the readministration of riluzole was followed by the relapse of hepatitis. These two observations strongly suggest that riluzole can induce acute hepatitis with associated hepatocellular damage and microvesicular steatosis. They also suggest that liver enzymes should be monitored during treatment with riluzole.",1999,3
9,10203437,Lupus-like syndrome caused by 5-aminosalicylic acid in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"Although 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) preparations used to treat inflammatory bowel disease are reported to have fewer side effects than sulphasalazine, increased clinical use of these compounds has resulted in increased reports of significant side effects.
To report four patients with antinuclear antibody-positive migratory arthralgias and acute inflammation unrelated to the underlying inflammatory bowel disease, fulfilling the criteria of a drug-induced lupus-like syndrome.
A university-affiliated teaching hospital.
Cessation of treatment with 5-ASA compounds.
The cases described constitute a drug-induced lupus-like syndrome. All patients improved rapidly after discontinuation of 5-ASA compounds.
Reversible lupus-like syndrome appears to be a rare but significant side effect of 5-ASA compounds. Patients treated with 5-ASA compounds who experience acute inflammatory symptoms or clinical deterioration not related to their gastrointestinal disease should be screened to rule out a lupus-like reaction.",1999,3
10,10225085,Methemoglobinemia after axillary block with bupivacaine and additional injection of lidocaine in the operative field.,"Methemoglobinemia may occur after the administration of various drugs, including some local anesthetics. We report a patient with chronic renal failure and ischemic heart disease who developed clinically significant methemoglobinemia after an axillary block with bupivacaine and additional injection of lidocaine in the operative field. Although the two local anesthetics usually do not cause methemoglobinemia, we suspect that the displacement of lidocaine from protein binding by bupivacaine, in combination with metabolic acidosis and treatment with other oxidants, was the reason for the development of methemoglobinemia.",1999,4
11,10229976,Detection of activated eosinophils in nasal polyps of an aspirin-induced asthma patient.,"Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) is frequently accompanied by nasal polyps. Eosinophil infiltration is a characteristic feature of nasal polyps associated with AIA. Even though steroids are well known to be effective on managing AIA and its nasal polyps, histochemical examinations after steroid therapy and at recurrence, involving eosinophil infiltration of nasal polyps, have been less studied. To know the histochemical effects of steroid treatment on eosinophil accumulation in nasal polyps of AIA and the histochemical feature of a recurring polyp and to detect distributional differences between storage and secreted forms of eosinophil cationic proteins, we carried out immunocytochemical labelling with antibodies against EGI (recognizing resting and activated eosinophils) and EG2 (recognizing only activated eosinophils), and determined eosinophil infiltration in nasal polyps that were obtained before and after steroid treatment, and at recurrence of polyps. A large number of eosinophils in AIA polyps were found before steroid treatment and at recurrence, and they were predominantly composed of activated eosinophils (EG2-positive). In contrast, eosinophil infiltration was rare in polyps obtained immediately after steroid treatment. This finding suggests that eosinophil infiltration may be associated with nasal polyp formation in AIA, and that activation of eosinophils plays an important role in accumulation of eosinophils and polyp formation beginning with the initial stage.",1999,3
12,10327035,Subacute encephalopathy after combination chemotherapy including moderate-dose methotrexate in a patient with gastric cancer.,"An episode of subacute encephalopathy after the infusion of a moderate dose of methotrexate (1500 mg/m2) (MTX) is reported in a young adult with metastastic gastric cancer. Weakness of the right arm, focal seizures, lethargy and confusion appeared on day 10. High signal intensity in periventricular white matter was observed on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Symptoms resolved spontaneously and completely after 48 h. We believe that this represents an unusual case of moderate-dose MTX-induced neurotoxicity in a patient with gastric cancer, which has not previously been reported.",1999,3
13,10332990,Pulmonary edema during acute infusion of epoprostenol in a patient with pulmonary hypertension and limited scleroderma.,"Epoprostenol (prostacyclin) is currently approved for treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension; however, it is being evaluated in other forms of pulmonary hypertension, particularly scleroderma. Side effects associated with this medication are usually minor; serious complications are most often due to the delivery system required for continuous infusion. We describe a life threatening side effect of acute epoprostenol infusion (pulmonary edema) in a patient with pulmonary hypertension associated with limited scleroderma and discuss its management and potential etiology. This is the first case where epoprostenol has been successfully reinstituted.",1999,5
14,10337682,Adverse reaction to prednisone in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Oral corticosteroids are the main therapeutic choice for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Adverse reactions to systemic corticosteroids rarely occur and the etiology is unclear in most cases. A 14-year-old girl with newly diagnosed SLE developed a pruritic bullous eruption while on prednisone. The patient had been treated successfully in the hospital with intravenous methylprednisolone. In preparation for discharge, the steroid preparation was changed to prednisone to which the patient reacted with a development of new crops of bullous lesions. Skin biopsy specimens of lesional areas showed a bullous eruption consistent with erythema multiforme. The patient underwent immediate and delayed hypersensitivity tests. Intradermal and patch tests to liquid prednisone were positive. The patient was discharged on oral methylprednisolone and has not had recurrence of the skin lesions. In conclusion, a case of prednisone sensitivity in a patient with SLE is presented here. An alternative preparation, methylprednisolone, was used to successfully treat her underlying condition.",0,0
15,10348150,Hydroxyurea-induced acute interstitial pneumonitis in a patient with essential thrombocythemia.,"Hydroxyurea is a drug widely used to control myeloproliferative disorders, due in part to its relative lack of severe side effects. We present a case of acute interstitial pneumonitis in a patient who was treated with hydroxyurea for essential thrombocythemia. The clinical course suggests that the interstitial pneumonitis was induced by hydroxyurea. This is the first case of hydroxyurea-induced acute interstitial pneumonitis reported in the literature.",1999,4
16,10357715,Allergic and irritant contact dermatitis to calcipotriol.,"Calcipotriol (Daivonex R; Leo Pharmaceuticals, Zurich, Switzerland) may cause irritation of the skin, whereas allergic reactions are less common. In the present study we describe two patients with different types of reaction patterns, one presenting as an allergic, the other as an irritant contact dermatitis. Irritative skin reactions were observed only at higher testings doses, in contrast to the allergic type of reaction, which occurred at a lower testing dose. The present observation suggests, that a batch of different testing doses, including lower testing doses may help to differentiate between an allergic type of contact dermatitis and an irritant type of reaction after treatment with calcipotriol.",1999,6
17,10367184,Myotonia associated with sarcoidosis: marked exacerbation with pravastatin.,"A 37-year-old man with sarcoidosis developed severe electrical and clinical myotonia while taking pravastatin for hypercholesterolemia. Myotonia associated with sarcoidosis is rare. Pravastatin is associated with myotonia in animals. This case suggests that sarcoidosis and pravastatin, two entities not frequently associated with myotonia, may interact in a synergistic manner to produce severe clinical myotonia in humans.",0,0
18,10393393,Aspirin sensitivity: the role for aspirin challenge and desensitization in postmyocardial infarction patients.,"Aspirin is one of the world's most commonly used medications and its use benefits many diverse conditions. Adverse reactions, however, are relatively common as well. Hypersensitivity to aspirin can be manifested as acute asthma, urticaria and/or angioedema, or a systemic anaphylactoid reaction. We report 3 cases in whom aspirin was indicated for secondary prophylaxis of myocardial infarction but in whom a remote history of an untoward reaction to it prevented its initial use. These patients all underwent further evaluation of their pulmonary and allergic history and all 3 were challenged with aspirin. Two patients were found not to be sensitive and started on aspirin, the other had a classic asthmatic reaction to the drug and was successfully desensitized to aspirin allowing for its use.",1999,0
19,10395123,Fixed drug eruption in hands caused by omeprazole.,"Omeprazole is one of the most widely prescribed gastric antisecretory drugs. It is generally well tolerated and significant adverse reactions occur rarely. The objective of this report is to describe a case of fixed drug eruption that occurred during omeprazole treatment.
A 37-year-old white female patient admitted with epigastric pain and heartburn symptoms. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed reflux esophagitis and the patient was given 20 mg b.i.d. omeprazole. She developed dark-red coloration on her hands, at the fourth day of treatment, which has been defined as fixed drug eruption. These lesions were attributed to treatment and recurred soon after a rechallenge with omeprazole.
Fixed drug eruption is associated with many drugs but this is the first such report with omeprazole. We suggest being aware of such reactions during omeprazole usage.",1999,6
20,10405480,Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis induced by salazosulfapyridine in a patient with ulcerative colitis.,"We report a case of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) induced by salazosulfapyridine in a patient with ulcerative colitis. A 26-year-old Japanese man, who had been receiving medical attention for ulcerative colitis for one year, presented with diffuse erythema and pustules on his face and trunk, malaise, and fever up to 39 degrees C one day after the administration of salazosulfapyridine. A skin biopsy specimen disclosed intracorneal pustule composed of neutrophils and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in the dermis. A drug lymphocyte stimulation test for salazoslufapyridine was positive, but the patch test was negative. Immunological mechanisms are suggested in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. We suspect that a similar immunological pathway played a role in the pathogenesis of AGEP appearing in psoriasis and ulcerative colitis.",1999,6
21,10410183,Marked elevation of serum creatine kinase associated with olanzapine therapy.,"To report a case of marked elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) associated with olanzapine therapy.
A 39-year-old white Jewish schizophrenic man treated with olanzapine developed an elevated serum CK concentration with a peak concentration of 4000 IU/L (normal < 230). No other diagnostic criteria for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) were present. On discontinuation of the drug, serum CK concentrations returned to normal within eight days.
Olanzapine, like other atypical antipsychotic drugs, may cause muscle injury with concomitant elevations of serum CK of muscle origin. We suggest that in patients treated with olanzapine, CK concentrations should be checked on initiation of therapy, within the first 48 hours, and weekly thereafter for at least one month. In addition, patients with clinical signs suggestive of NMS should be monitored more carefully. For those patients with a history of NMS, or even of isolated serum CK elevation during antipsychotic therapy, follow-up should be stricter.
Marked elevation of serum CK may be a possible complication of olanzapine therapy.",1999,6
22,10414481,Diclofenac-associated hepatitis.,"This patient, who had a history of osteoarthritis, had severe hepatitis 5 weeks after being started on diclofenac for increasing pain in the joints. A week before the onset of hepatitis, the patient complained of upper gastrointestinal symptoms and was treated for gastritis. Seven days later, she had full-blown, severe hepatitis. Diclofenac was immediately stopped, leading to a complete restoration of liver functions over the course of the next few months. We highlight the importance of having a high index of suspicion for hepatic side effects of diclofenac and emphasize the need for increased awareness of this rare but potentially serious problem. We also review relevant literature regarding incidence and management.",1999,7
23,10426918,Remission of psoriasis after treatment with interferon-alfa and 2-chlordeoxyadenosine for hairy cell leukemia.,"2-Chlordeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) is an antineoplastic/immunosuppressive agent used to treat hairy cell leukemia (HCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and low-grade lymphomas. Its immunomodulatory properties, however, may allow its future use in the treatment of psoriasis. We report a patient with psoriasis and HCL who was treated for 1 week with continuous intravenous infusion of 2-CdA for recurring HCL. Both the psoriasis and the HCL cleared. Four years after 2-CdA treatment, the patient has psoriasis on only 1% of his body surface area. 2-CdA induces lymphocytopenia, which may explain the improvement in this patient's psoriasis.",1999,8
24,10431414,Priapism as a complication of heparin therapy.,"One case of priapism occurred during heparin therapy for a previous surgical operation to the knee is reported. The association between heparin and priapism is often recognized; abnormal platelet aggregation could play a role in the pathogenesis of this side effect. A part from the kind of surgical treatment performed, priapism as a complication of heparin therapy might be functionally more severe than priapism due to other etiologies. Our observation would confirm this statement.",1999,6
25,10435399,Circadian rhythm of white blood cells during clozapine treatment.,"The atypical antipsychotic clozapine is effective in the treatment of patients with refractory schizophrenia. It carries a well-known risk of neutropenia and agranulocytosis, which necessitates the immediate discontinuation of clozapine.
We report a patient who developed neutropenia on clozapine, but behind the cell count decrease showed to be a diurnal variation of the white blood cells (WBC).
Due to the lack of efficacy of subsequent treatment of conventional and other atypical neuroleptics, treatment with clozapine was restarted after discontinuation. When the morning count of WBC began to fall, WBC count was repeated in the afternoons.
Careful blood cell monitoring showed a pronounced diurnal variation of WBC (2.9-4.2x10(9)/l in the morning and 3.6-7.1x10(9)/l in the afternoon) and granulocytes (0.8-1.4x10(9)/l and 2.9-5.5x10(9)/l, respectively).
Some patients may thus have a spuriously low cell count and may be unnecessarily denied effective treatment.",1999,6
26,10439378,Acute neutrophilic dermatosis induced by all-trans-retinoic acid treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia.,"All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is considered the recommended induction treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Although the dermatological side effects associated with ATRA treatment are relatively common, acute neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome) has only been rarely reported. We describe such a case who responded to chemotherapy and not to low doses of corticosteroids.",1999,7
27,10442258,Hair loss associated with paroxetine treatment: a case report.,"Alopecia and hair loss are rare side effects of psychotropic drugs. There are a few case reports on hair loss associated with tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but none deal specifically with paroxetine. We report on a 37-year-old female who complained of moderate hair loss during paroxetine treatment. Findings on discontinuation and rechallenge supported the assumption that the hair loss was a side effect of the paroxetine. Further investigation is needed to determine the scope of this troubling side effect.",0,0
28,10452772,Protamine allergy as a complication of insulin hypersensitivity: A case report.,"Although most patients receiving insulin produce insulin-specific IgE, significant allergic symptoms develop in very few of them. Patients receiving neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin are at increased risk for the development of protamine hypersensitivity. The case of a 19-year-old woman with insulin-dependent diabetes and regular and NPH insulin hypersensitivity is presented.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether desensitization to NPH insulin, as well as standard insulin desensitization, could control allergic symptoms in a patient allergic to both NPH and regular insulin.
The patient required insulin desensitization for severe urticaria, angioedema, and occasional wheezing resulting from her insulin dose. She underwent a standard protocol for insulin desensitization twice in a 2-month period, with persistence in her symptoms. She was found to have high protamine-specific, as well as insulin-specific, IgE levels, and because of her poor response to regular insulin desensitization, she was desensitized to both regular and NPH insulin.
Dual desensitization resulted in marked improvement in her symptoms. The patient had recurrence of urticaria and angioedema a year and a half later, at which point the NPH was stopped and she was desensitized to regular insulin. She continued to receive regular insulin 4 times per day over the following 3 years with only occasional hives.
Patients with insulin allergy may not have complete resolution of their symptoms after standard desensitization, particularly those patients with concomitant protamine allergy. These patients may require protamine/NPH desensitization, an alternative insulin preparation, or both.",1999,8
29,10458196,Apparent central nervous system depression in infants after the use of topical brimonidine.,"To report two cases in which topical brimonidine resulted in apparent central nervous system depression and unresponsiveness in an infant.
Review of two patients. An 11-day-old infant became lethargic and apneic after a single drop of brimonidine. These symptoms were reproduced after a second administration of brimonidine. A 5-month-old infant became lethargic and poorly responsive after receiving 1 drop of brimonidine in each eye.
The first patient required admission to the hospital for medical stabilization. He recovered without sequelae. The second patient recovered spontaneously approximately 2.5 hours after administration of brimonidine.
Topical brimonidine may be associated with central nervous system depression in infants. The use of brimonidine is not recommended in these patients until further data are available.",1999,8
30,10461415,Hepato-biliary abnormalities secondary to ceftriaxone use: a case report.,"Ceftriaxone was approved in 1997 for the treatment of otitis media despite previous studies that documented an association of ceftriaxone with elevated hepato-biliary enzymes and transient biliary stasis. The case cited here highlights the need for continued awareness education for physicians who may use ceftriaxone to treat common illnesses such as acute exudative tonsillitis and otitis media in children. Specifically, for children with a family history of gallbladder, biliary tract, liver or pancreas dysfunction, ceftriaxone may not be the drug of choice since the likelihood of complications is increased in this population. Additionally, ceftriaxone may cause problems in either adults or children with preexisting disease, who may not be well-nourished, or who may be dehydrated.",1999,8
31,10465148,Anterior lumbosacral radiculopathy after intrathecal methotrexate treatment.,"Intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate or cytosine arabinoside is the standard approach to prophylaxis and treatment of central nervous system leukemia in children. Progressive paraplegia, one of the devastating neurologic complications related to this mode of treatment, has been attributed to spinal cord toxicity. Reported are three children who developed progressive paraparesis after intrathecal methotrexate administration followed by complete or partial recovery. Gadolinium enhancement of anterior lumbosacral spinal nerve roots was demonstrated in all three patients, and an elevation of cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin G synthesis was evident in two patients with more severe symptoms. The clinical data suggest that anterior lumbosacral radiculopathy is also a type of neurologic complication associated with intrathecal methotrexate treatment.",1999,8
32,10466445,Successful treatment with arsenic trioxide of a patient with ATRA-resistant relapse of acute promyelocytic leukemia.,"Arsenic trioxide has recently been introduced as a promising new agent to treat refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In the present study, arsenic trioxide was given intravenously for 42 days to a 56-year-old female patient suffering from chemotherapy/ATRA-resistant APL, with 43% APL blasts in the bone marrow and elevated D-dimers. During the first days of arsenic trioxide treatment a rapid decrease in the D-dimers was seen (normal values reached until day 7), together with a slight decrease in peripheral blood leukocytes. This initial coagulation response was followed by a second phase of hematological response (starting on days 15-20) characterized by leukocytosis, occurrence of myeloid progenitor cells in the peripheral blood, and a decrease in bone marrow blasts (<1% on days 28 and 36). Finally, the patient entered complete hematological and cytogenetic remission, although the PML-RAR alpha fusion product was still detectable by PCR. These data confirm the therapeutic value of arsenic trioxide in relapsed/resistant APL.",1999,7
33,10467499,An infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome induced by minocycline: a third pattern of adverse drug reaction.,"A 22-year-old black man developed fever, chills, fatigue, night sweats, tender lymphadenopathy, and a generalized, pruritic, macular eruption 3 weeks after starting minocycline therapy for acne. His illness was also characterized by a palpable spleen tip, marked lower extremity and scrotal edema, and generalized lymphadenopathy. The patient had leukocytosis with a large percentage of atypical lymphocytes on peripheral smear and liver dysfunction. Titers for Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B, toxoplasmosis; and cytomegalovirus were all negative. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 viral load and antibodies were also negative. Marked improvement was noted after the discontinuation of minocycline and the use of systemic corticosteroids. With the negative viral serologies, the clinical picture was most consistent with an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome produced by the minocycline ingestion.",1999,8
34,10473079,Life-threatening toxicity in a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase-deficient patient after treatment with topical 5-fluorouracil.,"In humans, 80-90% of an administered dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is degraded by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD; EC 1.3.1.2), the initial rate-limiting enzyme in pyrimidine catabolism. Cancer patients with decreased DPD activity are at increased risk for severe toxicity including diarrhea, stomatitis, mucositis, myelosuppression, neurotoxicity, and, in some cases, death. We now report the first known cancer patient who developed life-threatening complications after treatment with topical 5-FU and was shown subsequently to have profound DPD deficiency. RT-PCR and genomic PCR methodologies were used to identify a G to A mutation in the GT 5' splicing recognition sequence of intron 14, resulting in a 165-bp deletion (corresponding to exon 14) in this patient's DPD mRNA. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were then used to demonstrate that the aberrant DPD mRNA is translated into a nonfunctional DPD protein that is ubiquitinated. We conclude that the presence of this metabolic defect combined with topical 5-FU (a drug demonstrating a narrow therapeutic index) results in the unusual presentation of life-threatening toxicity after treatment with a topical drug. These data further suggest that degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome-mediated system plays a role in the elimination of the DPD protein.",1999,8
35,10475726,An acute ischaemic event associated with the use of venlafaxine: a case report and proposed pathophysiological mechanisms.,"Venlafaxine, a structurally novel antidepressant, belongs to a new generation of antidepressants--the serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. In clinical trials, venlafaxine was found safe and effective in most patients. However, significant changes in vital signs (hyper- and hypotension) and cardiac conduction abnormalities were observed in a few patients, notably in elderly patients. We present a case of an elderly woman with a pre-existing history of ischaemic heart disease, who was treated with venlafaxine, and developed acute myocardial ischaemia within the first week of treatment. This is the first report of a possible association between an acute cardiovascular event and venlafaxine. The association of venlafaxine treatment with ischaemic events could be explained by its unique pharmacological and haemodynamic properties.",1999,0
36,10482872,Apparent cyclophosphamide (cytoxan) embryopathy: a distinct phenotype?,"Cyclophosphamide (CP) is an alkylating agent widely used in treating cancer and autoimmune disease. CP is classified as a pregnancy risk factor D drug and is teratogenic in animals, but population studies have not conclusively demonstrated teratogenicity in humans. Six isolated reports of prenatally exposed infants with various congenital anomalies exist, but to date no specific phenotype has been delineated. The purpose of this report is to document a new case of in utero CP exposure with multiple congenital anomalies and to establish an apparent CP embryopathy phenotype. The mother had systemic lupus erythematosus and cyclophosphamide exposure in the first trimester. She also took nifedipine, atenolol, clonidine, prednisone, aspirin, and potassium chloride throughout pregnancy. The infant had growth retardation and multiple anomalies including microbrachycephaly, coronal craniosynostosis, hypotelorism, shallow orbits, proptosis, blepharophimosis, small, abnormal ears, unilateral preauricular pit, broad, flat nasal bridge, microstomia, high-arched palate, micrognathia, preaxial upper limb and postaxial lower limb defects consisting of hypoplastic thumbs, and bilateral absence of the 4th and 5th toes. Chromosomes were apparently normal. The reported cases of in utero exposure to cyclosposphamide shared the following manifestations with our patient: growth deficiency, developmental delay, craniosynostosis, blepharophimosis, flat nasal bridge, abnormal ears, and distal limb defects including hypoplastic thumbs and oligodactyly.

37,10487084,Paradoxical seizures in phenytoin toxicity.,"Phenytoin toxicity is an uncommon problem seen in clinical practice. The predisposing factors for toxicity are hypoalbuminemia, chronic renal failure, hepatic dysfunction and drugs which interfere with phenytoin metabolism. Common manifestations of toxicity, like confusion and ataxia, are well known. A less well known phenomenon is paradoxical seizures. In this condition, seizures develop as the serum phenytoin level rises and decrease in frequency as levels drop. It may or may not be accompanied by other features of toxicity. We present three patients with paradoxical seizures; their serum phenytoin levels were 43.5 mcg/mL, 46.5 mcg/mL and 38.3 mcg/mL. In all cases, seizures were controlled by withdrawal of phenytoin and reduction of drug levels.",1999,4
38,10492493,Losartan-induced angioedema.,"To report a case of angioedema associated with losartan administration.
A 45-year-old white man with a history of hypertension and gout was treated with losartan/hydrochlorothiazide, allopurinol, and colchicine. The patient experienced two episodes of angioedema within a 10-hour period. On both occasions the symptoms resolved after treatment.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are associated with a relatively high incidence of angioedema. The incidence of angioedema secondary to losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is unknown. The patient reported in this case differs significantly from the two cases reported in the literature because he had normal renal function, no previous exposure to ACE inhibitors, the reaction was of late onset, and the symptoms recurred.
This case suggests that losartan can induce late-onset angioedema in patients with normal renal function and that the reaction can recur after initial resolution of the symptoms.",1999,9
39,10494874,Danazol and multiple hepatic adenomas: peculiar clinical findings in an acromegalic patient.,"Hepatic adenomas are rare tumors; they have been associated with the use of anabolic steroids. Acromegaly increases the overall risk of neoplasms. We report the case of a female acromegalic patient in whom multiple hepatic adenomas appeared soon after danazol treatment for uterine fibromatosis. Treatment of acromegaly with octreotide, followed by successful selective pituitary adenomectomy, stabilized the number and the size of the liver tumors. We suggest that oversecretions of GH and IGF-I were strong promoting factors for liver tumorigenesis in this patient.",1999,8

There remains a paucity of information pertaining to alternative anticoagulation strategies for use during cardiopulmonary bypass concomitant with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, especially in children. We report the successful treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and subsequent hemorrhagic complications postoperatively in a 2-year-old child with Danaparoid (orgaran). Emergent conduit revision with cardiopulmonary bypass was required for a thrombosed systemic-venous to pulmonary-arterial connection (completion modified Fontan procedure).

This neurocutaneous syndrome consists of angiomatosis of the skin and mucosa as well as the leptomeninges. This case report describes the classic presentation of the syndrome, emphasizing the oral manifestations. The radiographic and CT scan show the typical ""tram line"" intracranial calcifications. This case report presents a typical case of Sturge Weber Syndrome. It gives the radiological and CT scan findings and the important role played by them in the diagnosis of this syndrome. Emphasis is given to the differentiation of diphenylhydantoin induced gingival hyperplasia from the angiomatous enlargement of the gingiva before any treatment is planned.",0,0
45,10555917,In vitro inhibition of hematopoiesis in a patient with systemic sclerosis treated with D-penicillamine.,"A 66-year-old Japanese woman with severe scleroderma developed anemia and thrombocytopenia due to D-penicillamine (D-Pen) treatment, although the leukopenia was not markedly severe. Cessation of D-Pen and the start of corticosteroid therapy were followed by recovery from bicytopenia. We examined the in vitro inhibition of the clonogenic capacity of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells of this patient by D-Pen, and found strong inhibition in burst-forming unit-erythroid and colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte assays, but not in colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage assays. These findings suggest that bicytopenia in this patient was caused by D-Pen and may be due to different sensitivities in the hematopoietic lineage.",1999,11
46,10560960,Treatment of antithyroid drug-induced agranulocytosis by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a case of primum non nocere.,"A 48-year-old woman who was treated for thyrotoxicosis with methimazole developed agranulocytosis. The methimazole was stopped and treatment with subcutaneous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was initiated. Administration of the drug for 8 days did not effectively shorten the recovery period compared with the average reported in the literature without the drug, and may have triggered additional iatrogenic complications. A search of the literature yielded 15 instances of severe antithyroid-drug-induced granulocytopenia (ATDIA) (granulocyte count of less than 0.1 x 10(9)/L) treated with G-CSF. Of the 16 patients, including the 1 reported here, only 3 displayed significant shortening of the agranulocytic period after treatment. We conclude that routine therapeutic application of G-CSF in afebrile severe ATDIG is not justified, and in some cases may generate a cascade of iatrogenic adverse events.",1999,10

The first patient, who received gemcitabine for treatment of a carcinoma of the pancreas, required hemodialysis for 6 months. In the second case, a woman suffering from a cholangiocellular carcinoma, end-stage renal disease was irreversible.

49,10579985,The relationship between infliximab treatment and lymphoma in Crohn's disease.,"The relationship between chronic inflammatory conditions and malignancy is complex. We describe the clinical course of 2 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in whom lymphoma was diagnosed after treatment with infliximab. The first patient was a 61-year-old man with a 30-year history of fistulizing CD in whom B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed 9 months after treatment with infliximab. The second is a 29-year-old man with CD in whom nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed 3 weeks after infusion with infliximab. The lymphoma presented with pleural effusions, mediastinal and cervical adenopathy, and no gastrointestinal lesion. We describe the implications of these cases for the use of immunomodulatory therapy in CD and the questionable association between CD and lymphoma.",1999,12
50,10586009,Codeine intoxication in the neonate.,"Although opiates can provide patients with relief from pain and the discomfort of cough, the routine prescription of these drugs for infants demands caution and concern. Infants, particularly neonates, are not merely small adults requiring smaller dosages, but rather uniquely different patients. Neonates present with an immature physiology and biochemistry with respect to drug metabolism. We report a case of codeine intoxication in the neonate, in which the drug was prescribed for cough control during an emergency department visit.",1999,12
51,10589077,Hydroxyurea and sodium phenylbutyrate therapy in thalassemia intermedia.,"Hydroxyurea (HU) and sodium phenylbutyrate (SPB) have been shown to increase fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) levels in patients with thalassemia intermedia. The reported effects of these agents in increasing total Hb, however, have been inconsistent and there have been no studies on the combination of these medications. We describe the clinical response, as determined by increases in total Hb and decreased transfusion needs, in five patients with thalassemia intermedia treated with HU alone or in combination with SPB. All of the patients responded with increased levels of Hb F, but the responses in total Hb varied. Of the five patients, two had a marked response in total Hb in excess of 3 g/dl, two responded modestly with an increase in total Hb of 1-2 g/dl, and one did not respond. Prolonged responses were achieved with low doses of HU (3-10 mg/kg/day) and higher doses were associated with mild reversible hematologic or hepatic toxicity and no further increases in Hb. Sodium phenylbutyrate was added to treatment with HU in two patients, but failed to produce an increase in total Hb despite increasing Hb F levels. Of the four patients who responded to HU with an increase in total Hb, all reported symptomatic improvement and three have not required further transfusions. We conclude that low-dose HU therapy in patients with thalassemia intermedia may increase total Hb levels sufficiently to eliminate the need for transfusions. We, therefore, recommend a trial of HU for thalassemia intermedia patients in whom chronic transfusion therapy is being contemplated.",1999,12
52,10592946,Severe rhabdomyolysis following massive ingestion of oolong tea: caffeine intoxication with coexisting hyponatremia.,"A 36-y-o patient with schizophrenia, who had consumed gradually increasing quantities of oolong tea that eventually reached 15 L each day, became delirious and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. After abstinence from oolong tea his delirium resolved. He was transferred to our hospital when he was discovered to have acute renal failure with hyponatremia (118 mEq/L) and severe rhabdomyolysis (creatine phosphokinase, 227,200 IU/L). On admission rhabdomyolysis had begun to improve despite a worsening of the hyponatremia (113 mEq/L). With aggressive supportive therapy, including hypertonic saline administration and hemodialysis, the patient fully recovered without detectable sequelae. The clinical course suggests that caffeine, which is present in oolong tea, was mainly responsible for the rhabdomyolysis as well as the delirium, although severe hyponatremia has been reported to cause rhabdomyolysis on rare occasions. We hypothesize that caffeine toxicity injured the muscle cells, which were fragile due to the potassium depletion induced by the coexisting hyponatremia, to result in unusually severe rhabdomyolysis. The possibility of severe rhabdomyolysis should be considered in a patient with water intoxication due to massive ingestion of caffeine-containing beverages.",1999,12
53,10599932,Citalopram: an interaction study with clomipramine in a patient heterozygous for CYP2D6 genotype.,"A pharmacokinetic interaction between the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram and a tricyclic antidepressant, clomipramine, was noted in a patient treated for major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. After the addition of citalopram, a desmethylclomipramine plasma level increase and an 8-hydroacy-desmethylclomipramine plasma level decrease were observed. The CYP2D6 phenotype, determined when the patient received the antidepressant comedication, characterized a poor metabolizer status (dextromethorphan metabolic ratio >0.3), despite a heterozygous genotype containing a wild-type allele with extensive metabolic capacity and a mutant non-functional allele (CYP2D6*1A/CYP2D6*4A). This case seems to be one of the first descriptions of the clinical relevance of a CYP2D6 heterozygous genotype in a patient treated with antidepressant.",1999,11
54,10607332,Protease inhibitor-associated angiolipomatosis.,"Treatment with protease inhibitors in some persons infected with HIV-1 is associated with a syndrome of lipodystrophy manifesting as peripheral lipoatrophy, relative central adiposity, insulin resistance, and serum lipid abnormalities. We report 3 cases of HIV-1 infected patients who experienced symptomatic angiolipomas shortly after starting antiretroviral therapy including the protease inhibitor indinavir. The mechanism behind this observation may be similar to that of previously reported protease inhibitor-associated fat redistribution, but instead involving the adipose tissue of discrete uncommon benign tumors.",2000,1
55,10610018,Elevated serum triglycerides with clozapine resolved with risperidone in four patients.,"Serum triglyceride levels of four patients with psychotic disorders were decreased after switching therapy from clozapine to risperidone. In two patients clozapine was reinstated after risperidone was discontinued; serum triglyceride levels increased. This increase when clozapine was switched to risperidone and vice versa is consistent with our previous report of elevated serum triglyceride levels in clozapine-treated patients. Other reports show increases with the atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine and quetiapine. We believe serum triglyceride levels should be monitored in patients who have other cardiac risk factors and are receiving clozapine.",1999,9
56,10614572,Intravenous valproate associated with significant hypotension in the treatment of status epilepticus.,"Intravenous valproate has been suggested for the treatment of status epilepticus in part because of its relatively good cardiovascular safety profile. We report a case of severe hypotension associated with intravenous valproate used to treat status epilepticus in an 11-year-old girl. Valproate 960 mg (30 mg/kg) was infused over 1 hour. The patient's blood pressure decreased from a baseline of 130/80 mm Hg to 70/55 mm Hg, 39 minutes into the infusion. Although her seizures stopped, her blood pressure fluctuated between 90/60 mm Hg and 60/30 mm Hg over the next several hours, requiring treatment with intravenous fluids and pressor therapy. Endotracheal intubation eventually was performed. Once her blood pressure stabilized, the patient improved clinically. To our knowledge, this is the first report of significant hypotension associated with intravenous valproate in the treatment of status epilepticus in the pediatric population.",1999,12
57,10619721,Immunosuppressive treatment of rippling muscles in patients with myasthenia gravis.,Rippling muscle disease is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that may occur sporadically. In this report two patients presenting with rippling muscles followed by myasthenia gravis are described. Our first patient developed rippling muscles about 1 month after infection with Yersinia enterocolitica. Two years later myasthenia gravis appeared. Our second patient had a 2-year history of asthma prior to the onset of rippling muscles which preceded the myasthenic symptoms by 4-8 weeks. Acetylcholine receptor and anti-skeletal muscle antibody titers were positive in both patients. In both patients the rippling phenomena worsened with pyridostigmine treatment but markedly improved after immunosuppression with azathioprine.,1999,12
58,10633877,Theophylline intoxication mimicking diabetic ketoacidosis in a child.,"A 5-year-old boy presented with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting of blood. Twelve hours after admission, ""diabetic ketoacidosis"" was diagnosed on the basis of elevated glycaemia, glycosuria, ketonuria and a low bicarbonate blood level, which led to treatment with fluids and regular insulin infusion. Over a 36-hour period, insulin was progressively decreased and finally stopped because of the rapid fall and normalization of blood glucose concentration. Drug poisoning was suspected on the basis of persistent tachycardia in the absence of other signs of dehydration. Salicylate intoxication was excluded, and theophylline was finally incriminated. This compound, used by adults in the child's home, had caused accidental theophylline poisoning, mimicking diabetic ketoacidosis. Pre-diabetic immune markers were repeatedly negative, and no diabetes has developed after four years of follow-up. Thus, the transient increase in blood glucose was not related to a pre-diabetic status. A diagnosis of masked theophylline poisoning should be considered in similar situations involving a rapid decrease of insulin requirements.",1999,12
59,10646879,Methylene blue in the treatment and prevention of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy: report of 12 cases and a review of the literature.,"Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent used in the treatment of a variety of solid tumours. Ten to 15% of patients treated with ifosfamide develop an encephalopathy. Methylene blue (MB) may be used in the treatment of this encephalopathy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of MB in these patients and to review the literature. Between 1993 and 1997, 52 patients (age 16-77 years) with solid tumours were treated with ifosfamide in dosages ranging from 3 to 5 g m(-2) q3w when given in combination schedules and up to 12 g m(-2) q4w when given as a single agent. Twelve patients developed central nervous system (CNS) depression, defined as National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) neurocortical toxicity grade 2 or higher. Eight were treated with MB at a dose of 6 x 50 mg day(-1) intravenously (i.v.). Four recovered fully within 24 h, two recovered partially after 24 h and completely after 48 h while two recovered only after 72 h. Four patients did not receive MB and all recovered only after 48 h. Three patients received prophylaxis with MB at a dose of 4 x 50 mg day(-1) i.v. for the subsequent chemotherapy cycles. Two developed milder encephalopathy; one had no CNS depression at all. We conclude that MB is an effective treatment for ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy. Our findings suggest that it may also be used as a prophylactic agent.",2000,1
60,10650865,Portal vein thrombosis in a patient with severe haemophilia A and F V G1691A mutation during continuous infusion of F VIII after intramural jejunal bleeding--successful thrombolysis under heparin therapy.,"We report on a 14-year-old boy with severe haemophilia A who developed a portal vein thrombosis during continuous infusion of F VIII. For treatment of a posttraumatic intramural jejunal haematoma with extension into the mesenterium the patient received continuous infusion (CI) of a high purity F VIII concentrate, starting with an initial bolus injection of 100 IU F VIII/kg bw and followed by 4-5 IU F VIII/kg bw/h i.v. F VIII plasma activity ranged between 47 and 88%. Resorption of the haematoma was proven by abdominal ultrasonic follow-ups. After 3 weeks of CI a thrombus formation in the portal vein was detected by ultrasound and confirmed by duplex ultrasound. Subsequent to diagnosis the patient was heparinised with unfractionated heparin (UFH 300-450 IU/kg/d i.v.). In order to induce further resorption of the haematoma. F VIII concentrate was given concomitantly (50 IU/kg bw twice daily) during the initial phase of treatment. After 14 days of anticoagulant therapy with UFH, the regimen was changed to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; Fraxiparin 0.3; 2850 IU anti-X activity/d s.c.; bw 60 kg). F VIII dosage was gradually reduced with advanced resorption of the haematoma and thereafter switched to prophylaxis (40 IU/kg bw 3 times weekly). Complete lysis of the thrombus was observed after 6 months of treatment with UFH and LMWH respectively without any further complications. Thereafter LMWH was discontinued. Thrombophilic screening revealed no abnormalities except heterozygous F V G1691A.
The coexistence of a common prothrombotic risk factor and haemophilia may cause severe complications, in particular if the bleeding disorder has to be corrected temporarily by administration of the concerning deficient agent.",1999,12
61,10656221,Gliclazide-induced acute hepatitis.,"There are few reports in the literature related to sulfonylurea-induced hepatotoxicity. We describe the case of acute hepatitis induced by gliclazide, a second generation sulfonylurea. A 60-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus (type 2) developed an acute icteric hepatitis-like illness 6 weeks after the initiation of gliclazide therapy. Other causes of acute hepatocellular necrosis were excluded. Liver histology showed marked portal inflammation with lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils, associated with lobular inflammation (indicative of a histological pattern consistent with drug-induced hepatitis). The drug was immediately withdrawn and the patient was given glibenclamide. The patient recovered clinically and, in less than 4 weeks, her serum bilirubin and aminotransferases returned to normal levels. We believe that this is the first description of acute hepatitis caused by an idiosyncratic adverse reaction to gliclazide or to one of its metabolites. In conclusion, this case strongly suggests that gliclazide can induce acute icteric liver necro-inflammation which may be misdiagnosed clinically as acute viral hepatitis. In patients who show abnormal liver function tests, the immediate discontinuation of gliclazide is recommended.",2000,1
62,10667036,Clinical and pharmacological aspects of accidental triamcinolone acetonide overdosage: a case study.,"Local administration of corticosteroids for rheumatic diseases have had a long history of effective and well-tolerated use. We report here the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of an accidental triamcinolone acetonide (TCA) overdose. The presented patient was treated with 200 mg TCA and developed Cushing's syndrome 6 weeks later (cortisol and ACTH concentrations were below limits of detection, TCA concentrations were > 3 micrograms/l). Because of her severe symptoms, mifepristone was administered for a period of 19 days. Cortisol concentrations became detectable 2 days after initiation of mifepristone treatment and persisted, being detectable for a period of at least a week after cessation of the drug. Twenty days after cessation, cortisol concentrations were undetectable again. Cushing's syndrome persisted more than 6 months while TCA concentrations remained detectable for at least 80 days. Based on plasma TCA concentrations in our patient, we calculated a terminal half-life of TCA of 33 days as opposed to 5 days observed after intra-articular administration of a therapeutic dose of 40 mg TCA. We conclude that after an accidental overdose in this patient, body TCA disappearance was strongly prolonged due to a very slow (absorption) half-life of the drug in comparison to a therapeutic dose. This finding is explained by a 'flap-flop phenomenon' where drug absorption is the rate-limiting step of overall drug disposition. Caution is, therefore, needed to prevent undesired accumulation of TCA that may lead to protracted Cushing's syndrome.",2000,1
63,10679548,Bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia associated with the use of nitrofurantoin.,"The spectrum of nitrofurantoin lung injury continues to widen. The case histories are presented of two patients who developed lung disease associated with the use of nitrofurantoin with histological features of bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia (BOOP), a rare but recognised form of drug induced injury. The two middle aged women presented with respiratory symptoms after prolonged treatment with nitrofurantoin. Both had impaired lung function and abnormal computed tomographic scans, and their condition improved when nitrofurantoin was withdrawn and corticosteroid treatment commenced. The favourable outcome in these two patients contrasts with the fatal outcome of the two other reported cases of nitrofurantoin induced BOOP. We suggest that the previous classification of nitrofurantoin induced lung injury into ""acute"" and ""chronic"" injury is an oversimplification in view of the wide variety of pathological entities that have subsequently emerged.",2000,3
64,10682234,Intravenous administration of levodopa ameliorated a refractory akathisia case induced by interferon-alpha.,"A 28 year-old man with chronic hepatitis B was administered interferon-alpha (5 x 10(6) IU) intramuscularly once a day for 28 days. Eight days after the end of interferon treatment, he showed signs of inability to sit still for ten seconds and walked around constantly. His akathisia symptoms worsened thereafter. Clonazepam, thioridazine, beta-blockers, anticholinergics, and bromocriptine did not ameliorate his akathisia. Two days' administration of levomepromazine 100 mg led him to a coma for 2 days. Intravenous levodopa 25 mg ameliorated his akathisia symptoms drastically. He became completely premorbid 2 weeks after administration of levodopa. The present report illustrates a rare case of refractory akathisia after interferon-alpha treatment and also that levodopa treatment would be theoretically and practically useful in reducing the neurotoxicity associated with interferon-alpha.",0,0
65,1068531,Acute erythroid leukemia after cyclophosphamide therapy for multiple myeloma: report of two cases.,"The diagnosis of multiple myeloma was made in two white men, aged 55 and 59 years. They were treated with cyclophosphamide for 98 and 44 months respectively. Patient 1 also received a nine-month course of combined therapy with melphalan, procarbazine, and prednisone. Both developed acute erythroid leukemia, 98 and 71 months after the original diagnosis of myeloma, and died of subarachnoid hemorrhage and cardiac arrest. Patient 1 developed squamous cell carcinoma of the skin with recurrence, and Patient 2 developed anaplastic carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Palliative radiation therapy was given. The development of erythroid leukemia plus carcinoma in these two men suggests mutagenic change secondary to cyclophosphamide therapy.",1976,10

On rare occasions, severe complications such as respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, coma, and death have been reported in both adults and children. Presently, treatment of acute ibuprofen intoxication with complications requires supportive therapy until the symptoms resolve over 24 to 48 hours.

69,10717401,Sagittal sinus thrombosis associated with transient free protein S deficiency after L-asparaginase treatment: case report and review of the literature.,"Cerebral sinus thrombosis associated with acquired free protein S deficiency is very rare. We report the case of an adult patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who presented with repeated transient ischemic attacks followed by a seizure during consolidation treatment with L-asparaginase. Magnetic resonance of the brain showed a small cortical hemorrhagic infarct. Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis was demonstrated by cerebral angiogram. A marked decrease of the free form of protein S was documented. One month later, when the patient was free of symptoms, the follow-up free protein S antigen level was restored to the normal range. We suggest that the sagittal sinus thrombosis in this patient was caused by acquired, transient free protein S deficiency. This case also extends the clinical spectrum of cerebral sinus thrombosis to include recurrent transient ischemic attacks alternating with seizures.",2000,3

Two cases of polyarteritis nodosa and one case of pityriasis rosea-like drug eruption.,"The association of hepatitis B virus infection and vasculitis or other immune-mediated manifestations is well documented. Reports on such manifestations in relation to hepatitis B vaccination are scarce, however. We report 2 patients who developed polyarteritis nodosa following vaccination against hepatitis B. In one patient this resulted in an ischemic and necrotic digital ulcus, necessitating surgical amputation. The other patient presented with typical cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa which responded well to corticosteroid treatment. A third patient developed a severe pityrias rosea-like eruption. He was treated with topical steroids with healing of the lesions, leaving only post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The literature on these associations is reviewed.",0,0

74,10749332,Troglitazone-induced fulminant hepatic failure. Acute Liver Failure Study Group.,"The three reported cases demonstrate that troglitazone is an idiosyncratic hepatotoxin that can lead to irreversible liver injury. Thus, troglitazone should be prescribed with caution and should not be used as a first-line agent in the treatment of type II DM when potentially less toxic alternatives are available. It remains to be seen whether the hepatotoxicity associated with troglitazone is a drug-class effect or specific to troglitazone. Other thiazolidinediones currently in clinical trials may be able to provide the therapeutic benefits of troglitazone without significant hepatotoxicity. If troglitazone is used, frequent monitoring of serum aminotransferases and symptoms is mandatory. However, as illustrated by these and other cases reported to date, the onset of troglitazone-induced liver injury is insidious and temporally variable. Thus, the value of close monitoring and when, if ever, it is safe to stop such monitoring are currently unclear.",2000,3

Follow-up HRCT scans after withdrawal of the drug showed resolution of this supposedly irreversible pattern.",0,0
76,10755579,Fluoxetine-related death in a child with cytochrome P-450 2D6 genetic deficiency.,"The clinical course of a 9-year-old diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette's disorder and treated with a combination of methylphenidate, clonidine, and fluoxetine is described. The patient experienced over a 10-month period, signs and symptoms suggestive of metabolic toxicity marked by bouts of gastrointestinal distress, low-grade fever, incoordination, and disorientation. Generalized seizures were observed, and the patient lapsed into status epilepticus followed by cardiac arrest and subsequently expired. At autopsy, blood, brain, and other tissue concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were several-fold higher than expected based on literature reports for overdose situations. The medical examiner's report indicated death caused by fluoxetine toxicity. As the child's adoptive parents controlled medication access, they were investigated by social welfare agencies. Further genetic testing of autopsy tissue revealed the presence of a gene defect at the cytochrome P450 CYP2D locus, which results in poor metabolism of fluoxetine. As a result of this and other evidence, the investigation of the adoptive parents was terminated. This is the first report of a fluoxetine-related death in a child with a confirmed genetic polymorphism of the CYP2D6 gene that results in impaired drug metabolism. Issues relevant to child and adolescent psychopharmacology arising from this case are discussed.",2000,0
77,10759907,Spinal cord infarction during use of zolmitriptan: a case report.,"A 50-year-old woman with a history of migraine without aura, predominantly occurring around her menstrual periods, developed a spinal cord lesion following the use of zolmitriptan. The partial lesion of the cord at T7 predominantly involved the spinothalamic pathways on the left side. Clinical features suggested that the lesion was an ischemic infarct, and this was confirmed by an MRI scan. There were no other known risk factors for vascular disease. There has been mild improvement of her symptoms, but most of the symptoms did not resolve. There are isolated case reports of stroke secondary to the use of triptans, however, this is the first case of spinal cord infarction reported following the use of this group of drugs. The temporal relationship suggests that the spinal cord infarction may be related to the use of zolmitriptan.",2000,1
78,10772434,Outpatient carboplatin desensitization in a pediatric patient with bilateral optic glioma.,"To report a case of successful outpatient carboplatin desensitization in a pediatric patient with bilateral optic glioma.
A 10-year-old white girl with bilateral optic glioma developed a hypersensitivity reaction to carboplatin after nine courses. She had received 18 courses six years earlier without incident. A desensitization regimen was administered, and she has tolerated all subsequent courses of carboplatin therapy.
Carboplatin is an important chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of a variety of pediatric brain tumors. It is usually given in an outpatient setting. Hypersensitivity to this agent appears to develop after frequent exposure such as with the once-weekly regimens often used to treat brain tumors in pediatric patients.
Carboplatin desensitization can be successfully performed on an outpatient basis with close observation and cardiorespiratory monitoring. This regimen could prove useful for other patients who develop hypersensitivity reactions to carboplatin and allow therapy to continue.",2000,4
79,10774758,Perinatal vasoconstrictive renal insufficiency associated with maternal nimesulide use.,"A full-term newborn developed oliguric renal failure at 24 hr of life, which persisted for several days. Her mother ingested therapeutic doses of nimesulide, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor) drug, during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy. She was found at delivery to have developed oligohydramnion, esophagitis, and a bleeding peptic ulcer. The infant's fractional excretion of sodium was very low (0.5%) pointing for a severe vasoconstrictive mechanism involved. Renal sonogram showed hyperechogenic medullary papillae, which resolved during convalescence. This case emphasizes the importance of renal prostagandins in the control of vascular tone and sodium homeostasis. This is the first report of an adverse effect of fetal renal circulation by maternal ingestion of nimesulide.",1999,0
80,10779995,Secondary leukemia in a child with neuroblastoma while on oral etoposide: what is the cause?,"To date little has been reported about the risk of therapy-related leukaemia (t-AML) in children receiving oral etoposide therapy. The authors present a case of t-AML that developed in a child with metastatic neuroblastoma 18 months after he received oral etoposide, given for palliation purpose. The leukemic blasts were examined by morphological, immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic analyses. Although the t-AML developed following oral etoposide therapy, the child had previously received high-dose, multiagent chemotherapy, and rearrangement of the MLL gene was not demonstrated. The use of modern multiagent therapy often makes it difficult to appropriately apportion blame for causation of specific side effects. Moreover, the etiology of t-AML and mechanism of leukemogenesis are likely to be multifactorial and complex. Further studies on the precise association with different therapies are thus needed. Oral etoposide remains an effective palliative agent and its usage should not be excluded without most careful consideration of the risks.",0,0
81,10803790,Cyanamide-induced liver dysfunction after abstinence in alcoholics: a long-term follow-up study on four cases.,"Cyanamide, an aversive agent widely used in Japan, is known to induce various degrees of hepatic lesion with ground-glass inclusion bodies. When cyanamide-treated alcoholics relapse into drinking, more severe inflammation develops in the liver. However, it is controversial whether progressive hepatic lesions develop in complete abstainers as a result of long-term cyanamide treatment.
Case 1: A 53-year-old male alcoholic received cyanamide treatment for 4.5 months and completely abstained without cyanamide treatment for 6 years. A liver biopsy shortly after abstinence showed extensive pericellular fibrosis, but a biopsy after 6 years showed very mild fibrosis. Case 2: A 43-year-old male alcoholic remained completely abstinent with cyanamide treatment for 5 years and complained of general fatigue. His serum transaminases were slightly elevated and hepatic hyperechogenicity was observed on ultrasonography. Only mild pericellular fibrosis was present in the liver biopsy specimen obtained shortly after abstinence, but after 5 years the second liver biopsy showed that thin septum-like fibrosis that formed portal-to-portal and portal-to-central linkage had developed and ground-glass hepatocytes had emerged extensively. Case 3: A 29-year-old female alcoholic complained of general fatigue and a slight fever after 1.5 years of abstinence with cyanamide treatment. Slight elevation of serum transaminases and hepatic hyperechogenicity were observed. The liver biopsy showed extensive ground-glass hepatocytes and thin septum-like fibrosis that formed portal-to-portal linkage. Case 4: A 61-year-old male alcoholic who remained completely abstinent while taking cyanamide for 3 years showed slight elevation of serum transaminases. Liver biopsy showed extensive ground-glass hepatocytes and extension of thin septum-like fibers from portal tract to the lobule. Ultrasonography revealed hepatic hyperechogenicity.
In some abstainers who take cyanamide for several years, thin septum-like liver fibrosis progresses along with the emergence of ground-glass hepatocytes. Hepatic hyperechogenicity on ultrasonography and slight elevation of serum transaminases might erroneously lead to a diagnosis of hepatic steatosis without liver histology.",2000,4

83,10812579,Nonconvulsive status epilepticus: the role of morphine and its antagonist.,A 77-year-old woman with no history of epilepsy presented a probable nonconvulsive status epilepticus while receiving continuous intravenous morphine for back pain relating to vertebral metastasis of a malignant lymphoma. A generalized tonic-clonic seizure occurred a few minutes after injection of the morphine antagonist naloxone. No cerebral lesion was detected. This observation supports the notion of a possible pro-epileptogenic effect of opioid substances in association with metabolic and other toxic factors. Various hypotheses as to the complex actions of morphine and its antagonist in epileptogenesis are discussed.,2000,4
84,1082426,Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis induced by intraarterial vasopressin therapy.,"Two patients developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis after infusions of vasopressin into the superior mesenteric or gastroduodenal arteries for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The peritonitis in these patients differed from the typical picture in which a single aerobic organism is responsible, by the presence of multiple organisms, some of which were anaerobic. These findings suggest that the arterial vasoconstriction decreased the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and permitted the transmural migration of enteric organisms from the lumen of the bowel into the ascites-filled peritoneal cavity.",1976,3
85,10840527,Risperidone for control of agitation in dementia patients.,"Currently available research on the use of risperidone to manage agitation in patients with dementia is discussed. Dementia affects up to 70% of nursing-home patients, and more than 90% of them exhibit aggressive or agitated behavior or severe depression. Agitation includes combativeness, hyperactivity, disinhibition, wandering, and restlessness. Environmental interventions are preferred for mild symptoms; medications are the treatment of choice for severe manifestations. Traditional neuroleptics have been the mainstay of treatment for agitated behavior in persons with dementia, but these agents have limited efficacy and are associated with high rates of adverse effects, including worsening of already poor cognitive functioning. Although the literature on the use of risperidone in elderly patients with dementia consists largely of uncontrolled trials, case reports, and chart reviews, it appears that this agent is effective for managing agitation in this population and does so with a low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Risperidone may also be useful for treating acute agitation in patients with a high risk of EPS and for long-term treatment of ""sundowning"" (agitation and confusion starting in the late afternoon and worsening at night). A low initial dosage that is gradually adjusted upward is recommended. Risperidone appears effective in controlling agitation in patients with dementia and has a relatively benign adverse-effect profile, but more clinical trials are needed to elucidate its role for this indication.",2000,5
86,10870485,Staphylococcal pyomyositis in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.,"Pyomyositis is a rare disease, encountered mainly in tropical climates. The diagnosis of this entity is difficult, if not misdiagnosed, because of its rarity and its subacute presentation. We report of a 42-year-old man, in whom pyomyositis developed while he was receiving the standard chemotherapy for T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Three months following splenectomy, multiple abscesses occurred in the muscles of both thighs while the patient was receiving the third course of the CHOP regimen. A purulent exudate was aspirated from the abscesses under computed tomographic guidance. Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was cultured in the aspirate. Pyomyositis was completely resolved following the surgical drainage and the antistaphylococcal antibiotic treatment. This patient has shown that immunosuppression due to splenectomy, NHL, and chemotherapy, especially when using steroids, could be risk factors for pyomyositis in nontropical or semitropical countries.",2000,5

88,10879669,A case of normotensive scleroderma renal crisis after high-dose methylprednisolone treatment.,"A 68-year-old male was admitted for interstitial pneumonia associated with scleroderma. High-dose methylprednisolone was administered for treatment of the pneumonitis. Two weeks later, anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive increase in BUN, creatinine and LDH were observed. Although the blood pressure remained normotensive, renal biopsy showed thrombosis of the polar arterioles and glomerular capillaries. The affected interlobular artery included concentric intimal thickening and thrombosis in the lumen. Our findings suggested that the antecedent use of high-dose corticosteroids is involved in precipitating normotensive renal crisis. Corticosteroids should be used in low doses and with great caution in scleroderma patients.",2000,6

To describe the development of valproate-related reproductive endocrine disorders in women with epilepsy.
Case report.
Three patients developed a reproductive endocrine disorder during treatment with valproate. It was characterized by hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries in all cases, and it was associated with weight gain and menstrual disorders in 2 of the 3 women.
Replacing valproate with lamotrigine resulted in a decrease in serum testosterone concentrations in all 3 women. The polycystic changes disappeared from the ovaries in 2 of the women after valproate therapy was discontinued, and the 2 women who had gained weight and developed amenorrhea while being treated with valproate lost weight and resumed menstruating after the change in medication.
The 3 cases presented here illustrate the development of reproductive endocrine disorders after the initiation of valproate therapy in women with epilepsy. The disorders were characterized by hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries in all cases, and were associated with weight gain and menstrual disorders in 2 of the 3 women. An evaluation of ovarian structure and function should be considered in women of reproductive age being treated with valproate for epilepsy, especially if they develop menstrual cycle disturbances during treatment.",2000,7
91,10897389,Recurrent septicemia with lethal outcome during and after cyclosporine therapy in severe ulcerative colitis.,"High dose corticosteroids have been the mainstay in the treatment of fulminant ulcerative colitis (UC) for a long time. In the last years intravenous cyclosporine (CyA) has been reported to be rapidly effective and relatively safe in patients with severe corticosteroid-resistant UC. We report on a 64 year old patient with a severe flare-up of UC who responded well to intravenous CyA after a standard therapy with high dose corticosteroids alone had been ineffective. However, recurrent staphylococcus aureus sepsis developed during CyA therapy. Despite a long-time antibiotic therapy two further episodes of staphylococcus aureus sepsis occurred after discontinuation of CyA treatment. Being in remission with his UC the patient died 14 months later of staphylococcus aureus sepsis despite intense antibiotic treatment. Infectious complications of this therapeutic regime in severe UC are known but to our knowledge a recurrent sepsis complicating this therapy even after cessation of CyA has not been reported in the literature so far.",2000,0
92,10904571,Colchicine-induced myopathy in renal failure.,A 60 year-old woman with chronic renal failure developed acute proximal muscle weakness after receiving a regular dosage of colchicine. Elevation of muscle enzymes and electromyography were compatible with myopathy. Muscle biopsy revealed variation in muscle fiber size and few vacuolated fibers which were features of colchicine-induced myopathy. The clinical improvement and decreasing in muscle enzyme level occurred after colchicine withdrawal. Other potential causes of myopathy such as chronic renal failure and other drugs were ruled out. We suggested that colchicine should be used with caution in the presence of renal failure especially when other drugs which affect the metabolism of colchicine are also prescribed.,1997,10
93,10907391,Phantom limb pain as a manifestation of paclitaxel neurotoxicity.,"Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent with activity directed against several malignancies. It has multiple adverse effects including neurotoxicity. We describe 2 patients with prior amputation who experienced phantom limb pain (PLP) after receiving paclitaxel therapy. A third patient experienced disabling neurotoxicity in the extremity of a prior ulnar nerve and tendon transposition after receiving paclitaxel. This unique syndrome should be identified as a direct causal effect of paclitaxel. In this report, we review the pathophysiology of PLP and treatment options. Physicians should be aware that PLP can occur after initiation of paclitaxel.",2000,7

Subsequent cardiac arrest and prolonged cardiogenic shock required aggressive pharmacologic support, intraaortic balloon pump insertion, and mechanical ventilation. Four hemodialyses with charcoal hemoperfusion were performed over 72 h. Plasma atenolol levels decreased from 7.4 mg/L to 2.1 mg/L although significant rebound occurred between dialyses. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 5-10% prior to cardiac arrest, compared to baseline and following EF's of approximately 35%.

Previous associations with a drug or food allergy, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and elevated IgE levels suggest an atopic predisposition in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Diagnostic criteria are GI symptoms, eosinophilic infiltration proven by biopsy of the GI tract, and absence of parasitic infection. We describe a case of EGE manifested as an allergy to gemfibrozil.",2000,8
97,10970989,Lactic acidosis in the setting of antiretroviral therapy for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A case report and review of the literature.,"Type B lactic acidosis, a rare but often fatal disorder, has been reported in 21 AIDS patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). We present an AIDS patient with severe and prolonged lactic acidosis on stavudine and lamivudine. The lactic acidosis occurred in the absence of mitochondrial myopathy, hepatomegaly, or liver failure. This is the second report of lactic acidosis in a patient on stavudine and lamivudine. This patient recovered after aggressive supportive therapy including intravenous alkali and fluid administration as well as continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. A single dose of dichloroacetate (DCA) was associated with a decrease in the serum lactate level by 20%, which persisted for more than 24 h. Seventeen months after recovery, the patient was rechallenged with ART without recurrence of lactic acidosis. We review and summarize all reported cases of patients with ART-associated lactic acidosis reported in the English literature.",0,0
98,10981493,Propafenone-induced ataxia: report of three cases.,"Propafenone is an effective antiarrhythmic drug used widely for the treatment of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Although it is generally well tolerated, 30 to 45% of patients may experience adverse cardiac effects. In 15 to 20% of patients, adverse effects may involve other organ systems. A wide variety of adverse central nervous system effects have been reported in association with propafenone; dizziness is the most common. Ataxia caused by propafenone has been reported to the pharmaceutical companies and drug monitoring agencies, but has not been well described or emphasized in the medical literature. We describe 3 elderly patients with moderate to severe ataxia that occurred while they were taking propafenone.",2000,8
99,10987357,A case of sinus pause due to the proarrhythmia of pilsicainide.,"A 74-year-old man received oral administration of pilsicainide, a pure sodium channel blocker with slow recovery kinetics, to convert paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm and developed loss of consciousness two days later. The ECG monitoring revealed sinus pause with markedly prolonged PQ interval and QRS width. Two days after the drug was discontinued, the duration of the QRS complex was normalized. This drug is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, most of which is excreted from the kidney. The plasma concentration of pilsicainide, although not measured, must have been very high, since his renal function was impaired. When pilsicainide is prescribed in patients with coronary artery disease or renal dysfunction, close attention must be paid to avoid life-threatening arrhythmias due to high plasma concentrations of the drug. This is an interesting case because the proarrhthmia of the drug was not tachyarrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes, but sinus pause.",2000,5

102,110153,Paradoxical lithium neurotoxicity: a report of five cases and a hypothesis about risk for neurotoxicity.,"There have been many reports of probable lithium-induced organic brain syndromes occurring when serum lithium levels are within or close to the therapeutic range. The authors report on five patients who developed clinical syndromes suggestive of severe neurotoxicity during lithium treatment. In all cases lithium levels were between .75 and 1.7 mEq/liter. The patients who developed neurotoxicity had markedly higher global ratings of psychotic symptomatology and anxiety in the pretoxic period than did patients who never deveoped neurotoxicity. When the acute manic state is characterized by marked psychotic symptoms and intense anxiety, it may be associated with increased vulnerability to the development of severe lithium neurotoxicity.",1979,7
103,11020127,Protease inhibitor-induced carbamazepine toxicity.,"Neurologic manifestations of HIV infection are quite diverse and can develop into seizures. Because new drug therapies have been developed, it is important to know the interactions between antiretroviral and antiepileptic agents. A 36-year-old patient with HIV developed a set of progressive left hemiparesis and secondarily generalized partial seizures related to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Phenytoin and carbamazepine were necessary to control the seizures. Instead of diverse antiretroviral therapies, the viral load was increased. Protease inhibitors (ritonavir and saquinavir) were added to the treatment and the patient developed progressive ataxia related to carbamazepine toxicity. Carbamazepine was discontinued and the patient remained asymptomatic. The patient was diagnosed with carbamazepine toxicity related to the introduction of ritonavir. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of hepatic cytochrome P450, mainly the CYP3A4 isoform. Carbamazepine is metabolized by this subsystem. Ritonavir acted as a CYP3A4 inhibitor, diminishing carbamazepine metabolism and provoking an increase in serum levels and clinical toxicity. We present a case of interaction between ritonavir and carbamazepine. Interaction between antiepileptic and antiretroviral agents is an emergent problem caused by the increasing association of the two therapies. We recommend strict monitoring of serum antiepileptic drug (AED) levels to avoid toxicity and inadequate seizure control.",0,0
104,11022272,Anaphylaxis to calcitonin.,"The calcitonin is an hormone produced by the thyroid gland C cells. The salmon calcitonin is used in some osteomuscular diseases. There are few references of allergic reaction to this hormone. We introduce a case of a sixty years old woman with several previous episodes of rhinitis, conjunctivitis and perspiration immediately after the administration of salmon calcitonin with nasal spray or intramuscular administration (Calsynar). There were some temporal periods of good tolerance between these episodes.
Skin prick test (SPT), nasal and intramuscular challenge test with commercial salmon calcitonin (Miacalcic) were performed. Leukocyte histamine release test with salmon calcitonin and serum tryptase levels at baseline and after intramuscular challenge test were performed.
The patient skin prick test with commercial calcitonin (Miacalcic. 50 UI/ml) was positive and negative in controls. The nasal challenge test with a calcitonin nasal spray, up to 150 UI, was negative. The intramuscular challenge test with 25 UI of Miacalcic was positive with an immediate anaphylactic reaction. Whole blood histamine release studies were negative. Serum tryptase levels after intramuscular challenge did not increase significantly with regard to the basal levels.
We have introduced a case of anaphylaxis by calcitonin that suggest an IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction.",0,0
105,11026106,Minocycline as a cause of drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis. Report of four cases and comparison with autoimmune hepatitis.,"We describe the clinical and liver biopsy morphologic features for 4 patients with minocycline-induced autoimmune hepatitis (group 1). We compared the serum laboratory values and liver biopsy findings from group 1 with those from 10 patients with sporadic autoimmune hepatitis (group 2). All patients in group 1 had positive serum antinuclear antibody titers, but none had positive serum anti-smooth muscle antibody titers. The morphologic findings of group 1 biopsies were those of autoimmune hepatitis in all 4 patients. In addition, 1 of these biopsy specimens also had scattered single eosinophils, unlike autoimmune hepatitis. The mean histologic activity index scores for patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, were 6.7 and 5.4. No patients in group 1 had marked bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis, compared with 4 of 10 patients in group 2. Minocycline-induced autoimmune hepatitis is usually identical to sporadic autoimmune hepatitis. The absence of eosinophils does not exclude the possibility of a minocycline cause. In the absence of clinical or morphologic differences, a recent ingestion of minocycline should be excluded before the diagnosis of sporadic autoimmune hepatitis is established. Whether the drug is unmasking latent autoimmune hepatitis is unclear.",2000,10

Indications for GBP treatment were newly diagnosed epilepsy in one and painful paraesthesiae in the other. Both had no past history of psychiatric or behavioural disorder. Abnormal behaviour consisted of elevated mood, euphoria, and increased energy in both patients, and pressure of speech and decreased need for sleep in one of them. These symptoms were transient and fully reversible. One patient had to discontinue GBP. Behavioural changes were not related to seizure activity. They should be recognized as a possible side effect of GBP treatment in adults.",2000,10

The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known vigabatrin-attributed visual field loss, three of whom were reported previously. Six of the patients were no longer receiving vigabatrin.
The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer. Full visual electrophysiology, including flash electroretinography (ERG), pattern electroretinography, multifocal ERG using the VERIS system, electro-oculography, and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, was undertaken.
Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field. The eighth exhibited concentric constriction. Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits; two patients had subnormal Arden electro-oculography indices; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave. However, five patients showed delayed 30-Hz flicker b waves, and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials. Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level.
Marked visual field constriction appears to be associated with vigabatrin therapy. The field defects and some electrophysiological abnormalities persist when vigabatrin therapy is withdrawn.",2000,11
111,11093071,Adding low-dose antidepressants to interferon alpha treatment for chronic hepatitis C improved psychiatric tolerability in a patient with schizoaffective psychosis.,"Treatment of chronic hepatitis C with interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) is relatively contraindicated in patients with psychiatric disorders because of possible severe psychiatric side effects. We report on a case of a female patient with a chronic schizoaffective psychosis, who was treated for 3 months with 3 x 3 mio IE IFN-alpha s.c./week because of a chronic hepatitis C (genotype 1b). Psychosis was stable with flupentixol monotherapy. After 2 months, she developed a severe depressive syndrome which lead to suicidal ideation. Until this time, she was without any antidepressive medication. Depressive symptoms disappeared after interferon therapy was stopped. Under prophylactic treatment with low-dose trimipramine (50 mg) or nefazodone (200 mg/day) therapy with IFN-alpha 3 x 3 mio IE/week was re-established after several months and again 2 years later adding ribavirin 1200 mg/day, a virustaticum. In contrast to the symptoms during monotherapy with IFN-alpha, during the time of both combination treatments, no psychiatric side effects occurred. While for ribavirin antidepressant effects are not known, we suppose that antidepressants may prevent changes in serotonergic or noradrenergic neurotransmission caused by IFN-alpha.",2000,0
112,11096051,Management of hypophosphatemia induced by high-flux hemodiafiltration for the treatment of vancomycin toxicity: intravenous phosphorus therapy versus use of a phosphorus-enriched dialysate.,"Intensive high-flux hemodiafiltration is often used in the management of vancomycin toxicity. We describe two patients who developed hypophosphatemia as a consequence of this form of therapy. The first patient was treated with an intravenous phosphorus infusion. For the second patient, hypophosphatemia was corrected, during hemodiafiltration, with the use of a phosphorus-enriched dialysate. The latter dialysate was prepared by adding sodium phosphate salts to the ""base concentrate"" of a dual-concentrate, bicarbonate-based dialysate delivery system. This simple method was more efficient than intravenous therapy in ameliorating the hypophosphatemia secondary to aggressive hemodiafiltration treatment.",2000,12
113,11099623,Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for cerebral palsy: two complications of treatment.,"There is growing interest in the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO(2)) for children with cerebral palsy. Although there is no rigorous evidence to support this management, private hyperbaric centers have been established throughout the United States and Canada. There is likely to be increasing pressure on pediatricians and other health professionals to prescribe HBO(2). We describe 2 children with cerebral palsy who suffered significant morbidity immediately after treatment with hyperbaric oxygen. Both the temporal association and pathologic findings suggest that the hyperbaric treatment is likely to have been responsible for the resulting complications. As with any new therapy, we suggest waiting for the results of a randomized, controlled trial before recommending this treatment.",2000,12
114,11105373,Nail staining from hydroquinone cream.,Topical hydroquinone is used in the treatment of a number of skin conditions. A 33-year-old male presented with brown discolouration of the fingernails following the application of 4% hydroquinone in sorbolene cream and 0.1% tretinoin cream to the face intermittently for 9 months. The discolouration resolved when the creams were ceased.,2000,11
115,11109149,Gangrene of the fingertips after bleomycin and methotrexate.,"The increased use of cytostatic drugs, which are sometimes used in combination chemotherapy, may result in new and unusual cutaneous side effects. We describe a 57-year-old man with acral erythrocyanosis progressing to acute digital ischemia and gangrene that developed after combined chemotherapy (bleomycin and methotrexate) used to treat a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx. A leukocytoclastic vasculitis was found in both the acute phase and in the amputated fingertips. This supports the well-reported potential of bleomycin to trigger acral vascular toxicity.",2000,10
116,11111942,Diarrhea-associated over-anticoagulation in a patient taking warfarin: therapeutic role of cholestyramine.,We present a case of significant over-anticoagulation temporally associated with a bout of protracted diarrhea in a patient on warfarin therapy. Cholestyramine was utilized to interrupt the enterohepatic recycling of warfarin and for its antidiarrheal effects to prevent gastrointestinal vitamin K wasting. Cholestyramine enabled the use of very low doses of sc vitamin K1 (2 mg total) with subsequent attainment of a therapeutic International Normalized Ratio in 39 h.,2000,12
117,11122162,Recombinant VIIa concentrate in the management of bleeding following prothrombin complex concentrate-related myocardial infarction in patients with haemophilia and inhibitors.,"Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) and, more recently, activated prothrombin complex concentrates (APCCs), are widely used for the treatment of active bleeding in haemophiliacs with inhibitors. Myocardial infarction (MI), associated with the use of these concentrates, is a well-recognized, but uncommon, complication. We review the 14 previous cases published in the literature and describe two additional patients. MI related to the use of activated and non-activated PCCs predominantly affects young patients who often have no preceding history of, or risk factors for, MI and tends to be associated with large cumulative doses of concentrate. The most frequent pathological finding is myocardial haemorrhage, with no evidence of coronary artery atheroma or thrombosis. The management of further bleeding in these patients is difficult. We have safely used recombinant factor VIIa to treat bleeding in the immediate and long-term period following PCC-related MI.",2000,12
118,11126885,Occult quinine-induced thrombocytopenia.,"Quinine is universally used for the very common symptom of night leg cramps. Patients may not mention it among their medicines, since it is so commonly used and they regulate it themselves. A 68-year-old man suddenly developed extensive bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis was initially thought to be a recurrence of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) that had initially occurred in 1992 and had required splenectomy. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia was also considered, and he was told to stop all of his medicines. Only after three subsequent episodes of severe, symptomatic thrombocytopenia over the next four weeks did he say, upon repeat questioning, that he had continued to take quinine for night leg cramps. Even after a strict warning, he took another quinine tablet that evening, which triggered his fifth episode of severe thrombocytopenia, and confirmed the etiology of quinine-induced thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis thrombocytopenia caused by common drugs can be difficult, requiring persistent, explicit questions.",2000,11
119,11131346,Near fatal acute colchicine intoxication in a child. A case report.,"An 8-year-old child with familial Mediterranean fever exhibited signs of colchicine intoxication while receiving prophylactic doses of the drug. She developed gastrointestinal, central nervous system, cardiovascular and haematological disturbances. Over 2 months she had been drinking high doses of natural grapefruit juice which, combined with long-term colchicine therapy and a viral upper respiratory tract infection, increased her susceptibility to the drug.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time colchicine intoxication in this age group has been described in the English literature.",2000,12
120,11142491,Acute myeloid leukemia and lung cancer occurring in a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient treated with fludarabine and autologous peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation.,"An increased incidence of different malignancies associated to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been reported. The association of CLL and acute leukemia is a rare event described in < 1% of CLL, the type of acute leukemia being either from the lymphoid or more often from the myeloid lineage. The coexistence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and CLL in the same patient has been occasionally reported. Most of these cases have been associated with the administration of chemotherapy or radiotherapy for CLL, suggesting that the former may be a secondary leukemia. On the other hand, CLL could precede, but could also be diagnosed at the same, or delayed time as AML, suggesting the presence of other leukemogenic factors. We describe the exceptional development of AML and lung cancer in a patient with previously diagnosed CLL in minimal residual disease status after fludarabine treatment followed by autologous peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation.",2000,11
121,11147747,Serotonergic antidepressants and urinary incontinence.,"Many new serotonergic antidepressants have been introduced over the past decade. Although urinary incontinence is listed as one side effect of these drugs in their package inserts there is only one report in the literature. This concerns 2 male patients who experienced incontinence while taking venlafaxine. In the present paper the authors describe 2 female patients who developed incontinence secondary to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paroxetine and sertraline, as well as a third who developed this side effect on venlafaxine. In 2 of the 3 cases the patients were also taking lithium carbonate and beta-blockers, both of which could have contributed to the incontinence. Animal studies suggest that incontinence secondary to serotonergic antidepressants could be mediated by the 5HT4 receptors found on the bladder. Further research is needed to delineate the frequency of this troubling side effect and how best to treat it.",2000,12
122,11155197,Case studies in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.,"Type II heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immunological disorder characterized by antibodies to heparin-platelet factor 4 complexes and a high risk of thrombotic complications. Here, we present illustrative case histories to educate the reader on evaluation and management of this complex syndrome. Cases include typical and unusual presentations of the syndrome, and commonly encountered problems and pitfalls of therapy. Major points illustrated are, (1) occurrence of HIT with any dose or form of heparin; (2) misperceptions on the diagnostic criteria; (3) correct (thrombin inhibitors) and incorrect (platelet transfusions and warfarin) management; (4) influence of management strategy on clinical outcomes; (5) severity of the syndrome; and (6) potential for both anamnestic response to heparin and disappearance of HIT antibodies over time. Effective therapy of HIT involves both the prompt recognition of the syndrome and its proper management.",2000,11
123,11171531,Poorly controlled hypertension in a painter with chronic lead toxicity.,"In 1984, a 56-year-old house painter developed intractable pain in his back and other joints. After several unrevealing medical work-ups, he was found to have a high blood lead level (122 microg/dL); he has a history of scraping and sanding lead paint without adequate protective measures. The patient was hospitalized and chelated with EDTA four times over the next 5 years; each time he felt better at the end of his treatment, but he returned to largely the same working conditions. He developed hypertension in April 1989, underwent a final chelation, and retired. He was subsequently followed on a regular basis with repeated measurement of lead levels in blood and bone (using a K-x-ray fluorescence instrument) as well as clinical parameters. In 1995 his blood pressure became difficult to control despite a sequential increase in his antihypertensive medication dosages and the addition of new medications. In 1997 he began calcium supplementation and a high-calcium diet; his blood pressure declined markedly, allowing him to taper off of two of his four antihypertensive medications. This case demonstrates an occupational activity (construction) that has now become the dominant source of lead exposure for U.S. adults, the importance of a good occupational history to suspecting and making a diagnosis, the possible outcomes of chronic lead toxicity, and the importance of preventing further exposure and using proper methods to treat acute toxicity. It also highlights a current major etiologic question, that is, whether and to what degree lead exposure contributes to the development of hypertension, and raises the issue of whether lead-induced hypertension constitutes a subset of hypertension that is especially amenable to therapy with dietary calcium.",2001,1
124,11174414,Stevens-Johnson syndrome caused by the antiretroviral drug nevirapine.,"Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor widely used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection. Severe rash, including the Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), is the major toxicity of nevirapine and is described in the package labeling with a prominent, boxed warning. Though physicians treating large populations of patients with HIV are well aware of this complication, only one other report of nevirapine-associated SJS has been documented in the dermatology literature. We describe 2 cases of SJS related to nevirapine use and review the literature on this newly recognized association.",2001,2
125,11180704,Ileus after administration of cold remedy in an elderly diabetic patient treated with acarbose.,"A 69-year-old type 2 diabetic man was admitted due to diabetic gangrane. He had a history of subtotal gastrectomy. During hospitalization, he was treated with regular insulin and 300 mg/day of acarbose. He developed a low grade fever, cough and nasal discharge, and was given a compound ""cold"" remedy with anticholenergic properties. The next day, he suffered from a paralytic ileus. Oral intake and acarbose were withheld and the ileus spontaneously resolved after 2 days. These finding indicate the possibility that the ileus was triggered by drugs with anticholinergic properties in this elderly diabetic patient treated with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.",2001,2
126,11191005,Management of hypertension and dyslipidaemia in patients presenting with hyperuricaemia: case histories.,"A number of studies have shown that hyperuricaemia is associated with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease. It has been proposed that the elevated serum uric acid levels are linked to other risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes. Hyperuricaemia is commonly encountered in patients with essential hypertension and is considered as a risk factor for morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. In addition, lipid abnormalities (mainly hypertriglyceridaemia) are also found more frequently in hypertensive patients than in normotensives. There is evidence that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan, increases urate excretion by reducing reabsorption of urate in the renal proximal tubule. It is also known that fibric acid derivatives (fibrates) have several beneficial actions in addition to their lipid-lowering capacity. Fenofibrate administration is associated with a uric acid lowering effect. In this respect, we present two patients with hypertension and dyslipidaemia together with elevated serum uric acid levels. We also discuss (in the format of questions and answers) the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association of serum uric acid with cardiovascular disease, and we review the relevant literature to justify an evidence-based decision to choose an antihypetensive agent (losartan) or a lipid-lowering drug (fenofibrate) with an additional hypouricaemic effect.",2000,0
127,11200291,Atrial fibrillation occurring in a patient taking etanercept plus methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis.,"A 57-year-old man with nodular rheumatoid arthritis was started on a combination of etanercept and methotrexate. After treatment for five months on this therapy, he presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation. While this report is anecdotal, any new drug warrants intense monitoring for unexpected toxicities in the post-marketing period. Etanercept is being tried in patients with congestive heart failure, where TNF-a seems to be increased. Further surveillance and caution are suggested in patients with known coronary artery disease or atrial dysrhythmia.",2000,12
128,11202801,Hepatic angiosarcoma occurring after cyclophosphamide therapy: case report and review of the literature.,"A 54-year-old man with polyarteritis nodosa developed acute onset of right upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with a large liver mass. Transvenous liver biopsy revealed hepatic angiosarcoma, a rare liver tumor classically associated with environmental toxins. He had been treated with oral cyclophosphamide for 13 years. A review of the literature revealed two other cases of hepatic angiosarcoma in patients after long-term cyclophosphamide treatment. We propose that cyclophosphamide be added to the list of exposures potentially associated with hepatic angiosarcoma.",2000,12
129,11207969,Toxic epidermal necrolysis after the use of high-dose cytosine arabinoside.,"We report a fatal case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) resulting from a high dose of cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). A 13-year-old girl with acute lymphocytic leukemia was treated according to the protocol of the BFM Group (BFM-95, HRG). On the fifth day after administration of a high dose of ARA-C (2 g/m2 intravenously every 12 hours), she developed bullous lesions on the hands and soles that disseminated, evolving to necrosis, sepsis, and death on the 22nd day. ARA-C is frequently associated with dermatologic toxicity, but this is only the second case of toxic epidermal necrolysis described in connection with this drug.",0,0
130,11212595,Quetiapine and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS): case report and review of atypical antipsychotic-induced OCS.,"The atypical antipsychotics have advanced the treatment of schizophrenia and have proved to be effective agents in treating other disorders with or without psychotic features. We review the literature concerning an increasingly reported and interesting adverse effect, atypical antipsychotic-induced obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS). The first known report of quetiapine exacerbating OCS in a 43-year-old man with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), trichotillomania, delusional disorder and bipolar II disorder is presented. Mechanisms, including 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C antagonism, serotonergic regulation of dopamine systems and putative dopaminergic subtypes of OCS and OCD, are discussed. Given the paradoxical efficacy of the atypical antipsychotics in pure OCD, the neurobiology and comorbidity of OCD and schizophrenia, as well as the increasing use of atypical antipsychotics, a cautious and rational pharmacotherapeutic treatment approach is recommended.",2001,1
131,11215836,Possible serotonin syndrome associated with clomipramine after withdrawal of clozapine.,"To report on the possible development of serotonin syndrome in a patient receiving clomipramine after clozapine was withdrawn from the treatment regimen.
A 44-year-old white man with a 23-year history of undifferentiated schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive behavior had been treated with clozapine and clomipramine for several years. He tolerated both agents together well, with the exception of experiencing chronic constipation. Clomipramine was tapered and reduced to 50 mg over a period of 10 days. A worsening of ritualistic behavior was noted, and the clomipramine dosage was increased to 150 mg/d over 14 days. Simultaneously with the clomipramine dosage increase, clozapine was tapered and stopped ever a period of 19 days. The day after clozapine was stopped, while he was still receiving clomipramine 150 mg/d, he began behaving oddly, started sweating profusely, shivering, and became tremulous, agitated, and confused. He was diagnosed with possible serotonin syndrome; his symptoms resolved after clomipramine was stopped but before clozapine was restarted eight days later.
There are similarities in symptoms between serotonin syndrome and clozapine withdrawal. This article discusses the reasons why this case may represent serotonin syndrome rather than clozapine withdrawal and the possible pharmacologic mechanisms involved.
Clinicians should be aware that removing a serotonin-2a (S-HT2a) antagonist 1mm a treatment regimen including an agent that increases serotonin in the synaptic cleft may worsen clozapine withdrawal or potentially result in serious adverse drug reactions, such as serotonin syndrome.",2001,2
132,11225532,Quinine induced coagulopathy--a near fatal experience.,"A 67 year old man presented to his local dentist for restorative treatment. He stated he was fit and well and denied taking any medications. When he was given an inferior alveolar nerve block, excessive bleeding was noted at the injection site and the dentist advised the patient see an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. An appointment was made for the patient but he did not attend. Three days later, he presented with evidence of massive deep haemorrhage to the point of airway compromise. He underwent hospital admission, early intubation, intensive care for nine days and hospitalization for six weeks. The cause of his bleeding was a severe thrombocytopoaenia, induced by chronic ingestion of quinine. He was self-medicating with this to relieve muscular cramps. Despite this experience, the patient continued to deny that quinine was the cause of his problem and that he had failed in his obligations to advise the dentist of his drug history. Dentists need to be alert to the risk that patients may not reveal their true medical history. There are, however, obligations on the dentist to ensure the accuracy of information the patient gives and to ensure that patients whom they believe are at risk follow their advice. Teamwork and skillful airway management prevented this patient's demise.",2000,12
133,11236070,Dose-dependent olanzapine-associated leukopenia: three case reports.,"Leukopenia and agranulocytosis are well reported and dangerous haematological side-effects associated with the use of typical and atypical antipsychotics. These potentially life-threatening phenomena have led to treatment discontinuation and the consequent reemergence of psychiatric symptoms. We report three cases of patients who developed leukopenia during olanzapine treatment. In each case, the leukopenia was dose-dependent. Reduction in the dose of olanzapine was followed by normalization of the white blood count which allowed continuation of the medication. These cases suggest the possibility that, in some patients, leukopenia or agranulocytosis during olanzapine treatment might be dose-related. Thus, olanzapine dose reduction may permit treatment continuation where this is clinically indicated. In our cases, haematological side-effects were satisfactorily controlled by dose reduction without allowing the reemergence of psychiatric symptoms. This clinical management may offer an alternative to treatment suspension. A careful monitoring of the white blood count is obviously recommended. Olanzapine may be considered a potential and safer treatment for a this specific group of patients.",2001,3
134,11243427,Ectropion secondary to bolus injection of 5-fluorouracil.,"5-fluorouracil (5-FU) targets rapidly dividing cancer cell populations. In turn, it may cause inflammation in such rapidly dividing tissues as the corneal epithelium, conjunctiva, and tear duct. Inflammation may be exacerbated by pre-existing dermatologic conditions. This case report describes a rare combination of facial dermatologic toxicity and ectropion.
A 76-year-old man came to us in October 1998 with symptoms of foreign body sensation, epiphora, and difficulty removing his contact lenses. His medical history was significant for 5-FU bolus injections for intestinal cancer since May 1998. Examination revealed facial erythema and eczema, ectropion, blepharitis, chemosis, lid teleangectasia, and contact lens-related corneal edema. Differential diagnoses included ocular rosacea with cicatrizing conjunctivitis and 5-FU-induced ectropion. He was treated and monitored over the subsequent several months. As of December 1998, only mild ectropion persisted.
Patients with 5-FU-induced ectropion experience tender, red, scaled lids, making contact lens wear difficult. Therefore, contact lens wear should be discontinued to prevent further complications. This patient's ectropion and facial eczema may have been confounded by ocular rosacea. Exacerbation of 5-FU dermatologic toxicities in patients with preexisting conditions suggests the importance of aggressive ocular prophylaxis, using frequent ocular lubrication and topical steroid preparations with concurrent medical management of pre-existing dermatologic conditions.
This case illustrates a potential link between dermatologic and ocular 5-FU toxicities. Further research and better communication among health care professionals are needed to determine if prophylaxis can reduce adverse ocular events.",2001,2
135,1124417,Renal failure associated with acetazolamide therapy for glaucoma.,Presented is a case of acute renal failure induced by acetazolamide therapy for glaucoma. The 69-year-old patients recovered rapidly after oral administration of fluids and sodium bicarbonate. This sulfonamide like nephropathy should be differentiated from acetazolamide-related calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis.,1975,4
136,11247558,Ischaemic colitis in a patient taking meloxicam.,"The safety of cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) preferential inhibitors such as meloxicam is debated. We describe a patient who presented with bloody diarrhoea after 15 mg meloxicam daily for 10 days for osteoarthritis. The endoscopic and histological features were consistent with the diagnosis of ischaemic colitis. Symptoms and endoscopic lesions quickly regressed within 1 week of meloxicam withdrawal. There was no evidence of another cause of colonic ischaemia. We suggest that meloxicam might have intestinal toxic effects when taken in high doses, because of reduced COX-2 selectivity.",2001,3
137,11250985,Serious adverse events experienced by patients with chronic heart failure taking spironolactone.,"In patients with chronic heart failure, spironolactone added to conventional treatment may lead to serious and, occasionally, fatal hyperkalaemia. In some cases this seems to happen because spironolactone causes diarrhoea. Four cases involving men with New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure are presented. As these cases revealed, close monitoring of blood chemistry is mandatory after starting spironolactone, and patients should be advised to stop spironolactone immediately if diarrhoea develops.",2001,4
138,11292139,Radiation recall with oxaliplatin: report of a case and a review of the literature.,Oxaliplatin is a new platinum derivative that has significant activity in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Some of these patients may have been previously treated with radiotherapy. The interaction of radiotherapy with oxaliplatin needs to be further studied. We report a patient with advanced colonic carcinoma who was treated with concomitant chemoirradiation with oxaliplatin and developed a peculiar dermnatitis in the irradiated field after being exposed to subsequent chemotherapy with oxaliplatin.,2001,0

An 11-year-old boy developed a severe enteropathy 2 years after initiation of clofazimine treatment for graft-versus-host disease. Clofazimine enteropathy caused by crystal deposition can be life-threatening.",2001,4
140,11302479,Management of heparin allergy during pregnancy with danaparoid.,"We report a patient who presented with a left proximal deep vein thrombosis at 25 + 5 weeks gestation. She developed a severe urticarial rash 3 weeks following initiation of therapy with Enoxaparin. The patient was heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation. She was treated with subcutaneous twice-daily danaparoid (Orgaran) for the remainder of the pregnancy, achieving anti-Xa levels in the therapeutic range 0.5-1.0 IU/ml. Delivery was at term by caesarean section 2 days after spontaneous rupture of membranes and failure to progress in labour. Danaparoid was withheld during this time. Danaparoid was restarted 3 h post delivery and the patient anticoagulated with warfarin in the post-partum period. There was no recurrence of thrombosis or bleeding events during therapy with danaparoid. No anti-Xa activity was demonstrated in breast milk.",2001,3

142,11319599,Indolent aspergillus arthritis complicating fludarabine-based non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation.,"Fungal arthritis and osteomyelitis are rare and documented mainly in immunocompromised or neutropenic patients. Patients receiving therapeutic immunosuppression for organ transplants have also reported to suffer from aspergillus osteoarthritis. We describe two patients with aspergillus arthritis of the knee joint following fludarabine-based non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation. Both were suffering from acute and chronic GVHD and treated with heavy immunosuppression including steroids and cyclosporine. Interestingly in one of our patients, the arthritis was almost asymptomatic and did not spread to other organs. Heavy pre- and post-transplant immunosuppression is a major risk factor for invasive fungal infection, which can involve remote organs and manifest in an indolent and atypical manner.",2001,3

Single case report.
The patient, a 27-year-old married Japanese woman with borderline personality disorder, developed an increased libido with the administration of fluvoxamine. The increased libido disappeared after fluvoxamine was discontinued.
The present findings suggest that fluvoxamine can cause increased libido in some patients.",2001,4
144,11332679,Successful treatment of visceral leishmaniasis with allopurinol plus ketoconazole in an infant who developed pancreatitis caused by meglumine antimoniate.,"Pentavalent antimony is still the drug of choice in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. Pantavalent antimony can cause a wide range of adverse effects, the most serious of which are cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Acute pancreatitis is a rarely reported adverse effect. An infant who developed pancreatitis during meglumine antimoniate treatment for visceral leishmaniasis and who was successfully treated with a combination of allopurinol and ketoconazole is reported.",2001,4
145,11335880,Hashimoto's disease during interferon-alpha therapy in a patient with pre-treatment negative anti-thyroid autoantibodies and with the specific genetic susceptibility to the thyroid disease.,"The authors described a case of Hashimoto's disease during interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment for chronic viral C hepatitis in a patient with the specific genetic susceptibility associated with the thyroid disease.
A 60-year-old woman with chronic active viral C hepatitis (HCV genotype = 3a) started IFN-alpha therapy in November '96. Before treatment thyroid function tests were normal and anti-thyroid (anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase) Abs were negative. During IFN therapy, serum aminotransferases fell within the normal range and viremia (serum HCV-RNA) became negative after one year. After 20 months, the patient presented clinical features of primary hypothyroidism. Anti-thyroid Abs were found positive. Hormonal, ultrasonographic, radioiodine scanning and fine needle aspiration findings were consistent with the diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The tissutal typing of the patient showed the presence of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) DRB1*11 gene (corresponding to DR5 antigen). IFN-alpha therapy was suspended and a treatment with l-T4 started. Chronic viral infection relapsed after the suspension of the IFN-alpha therapy.
This case report showed that the clinical appearance of Hashimoto's disease after IFN-alpha therapy for chronic C hepatitis in our patient was associated with a specific genetic predisposition (DR5) for this pathology. Further studies are necessary to evaluate whether the study of HLA antigens may be a very useful tool to detect the patients with a predisposition to develop autoimmune thyroiditis, in order to make a early diagnosis of thyroid disorders during the IFN-alpha treatment.",2001,0
146,11341670,Reversible pheripheral edema in female patients taking proton pump inhibitors for peptic acid diseases.,"Pheripheral edema was observed in five female patients after taking proton pump inhibitors omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole for 7-15 days for peptic acid diseases in recommended standard doses. Edema disappeared two to three days after stopping therapy but reappeared in all five patients after being reexposed to the drugs. In three of the patients drug kinetic investigations were performed and revealed a slow metabolizer status. During dose-finding studies for intravenous proton pump inhibitors omeprazole and pantoprazole, three of six young female volunteers receiving omeprazole and two young female volunteers receiving pantoprazole developed peripheral edema within 8 hr when high doses of the proton pump inhibitors were applied by continuous infusion together with large volumes of fluid. The edema disappeared within 24 hr after stopping the infusion therapy. Serum hormone concentrations in these patients did not change during therapy, neither did the edema factor C1-esterase inhibitor. As a possible mechanism, a competitive inhibition at the receptor site of female hormones involved in water regulation is suspected.",2001,5
147,11346113,5: Movement disorders I: parkinsonism and the akinetic-rigid syndromes.,"The major features of akinetic-rigid syndromes are bradykinesia (small, slow movements), rigidity and tremor, often summarised as ""parkinsonism"". Approximately 80% of akinetic-rigid syndromes are due to Parkinson's disease. Treatment of Parkinson's disease should be determined by level of disability and handicap. The combination of levodopa and peripheral dopadecarboxylase inhibitor is the most efficacious symptomatic treatment for Parkinson's disease. Motor fluctuations appear after 2-3 years of levodopa treatment, and affect at least 50% of patients after five years. Surgery can relieve refractory tremor and dyskinesias, but does not alter disease progression or need for drug therapy.",2001,4
148,11352235,Leflunomide-associated weight loss in rheumatoid arthritis.,"To determine the frequency of weight loss in patients treated with leflunomide for rheumatoid arthritis at an arthritis referral center.
We queried 35 rheumatologists at the Robert Breck Brigham Arthritis Center to determine if weight loss had occurred as an adverse event in patients treated with leflunomide between November 1998 and January 2000. Five such patients were identified and their clinical course was reviewed.
Five of 70 patients who had begun leflunomide therapy had significant weight loss that could not be linked to other identifiable etiologies. The amount of weight loss was substantial in this group of patients, ranging from 19 pounds to 53 pounds. All patients had normal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and no other gastrointestinal complaints; evaluation revealed no other cause for the weight loss. Despite the significant weight loss, 4 of the 5 patients continued to take the drug due to its efficacy.
Significant weight loss is a potential adverse event in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with leflunomide. Awareness of this may obviate the need for extensive medical evaluations.",2001,5
149,11359026,Neurotoxicity of valacyclovir in peritoneal dialysis: a pharmacokinetic study.,"Valacyclovir is an effective oral agent for the treatment of herpes virus infection, however, the pharmacokinetics of the drug are altered in renal failure. It is increasingly recognized that dose adjustment of oral valacyclovir in renal failure is necessary to avoid neurotoxicity. We studied this drug in a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and immunocompromised patient. She developed neurotoxicity with an adjustment dosage of valacyclovir for a cutaneous zoster infection. The elimination half-time (15 h) was similar to that reported for end-stage renal disease patients, while the steady-state volume of distribution (85 l) and the area under the curve concentration (127 mg/l.h) were greater. The mean CAPD dialysance was only 5.27 ml/min with less than 1% of an administered dose being recovered in the 24-hour dialysate. 48 h after interrupting treatment, she recovered normal neurological status and 500 mg of valacyclovir every 2 days was effective and well tolerated.",0,0
150,11373877,Avascular necrosis of the femoral head in patients with prostate cancer treated with cyproterone acetate and radiotherapy.,"We report the case histories of two patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, both of whom had been treated with steroidal anti-androgen therapy in the form of cyproterone acetate prior to radical or palliative pelvic irradiation, and who subsequently developed femoral head avascular necrosis. This is a diagnosis that should be considered in patients with prostate cancer who present with hip pain in the absence of biochemical evidence of disease progression.",2001,0
151,11388112,Levofloxacin induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with normal QT interval.,"Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) is a form of ventricular tachycardia characterized by QRS complexes that seem to change direction during the tachycardia. If associated with a prolonged QT interval, it is called torsades de pointes. In the absence of a congenital long QT syndrome, torsades is seen with certain drugs such as antiarrhythmic agents (Class IA, IC, III), psychotropic medications, antidepressants, antihistamines, and electrolyte disturbances. We report the first case of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with normal QT interval associated with the oral use of levofloxacin in the absence of other etiologies known to cause these arrhythmias.",2001,5
152,11399735,Ticlopidine-induced interstitial pulmonary disease: a case report.,"We report a case of interstitial pulmonary disease that occurred together with lymphocytic colitis during treatment with ticlopidine. The drug was prescribed for transient ischemic cerebrovascular accidents. Ticlopidine treatment was stopped, and a prolonged course of prednisone was necessary to treat the pulmonary and intestinal symptoms. So far, few cases of pulmonary side effects caused by ticlopidine have been reported. This case is unique in that interstitial lung disease evolved in parallel with colitis and caused severe hypoxemia. Special care should be taken when pulmonary symptoms appear in association with ticlopidine treatment.",2001,6
153,11406880,Methadone-induced myoclonus in advanced cancer.,"Methadone is recommended as being free of some of the neuropsychological side effects noticed with morphine, which are attributed to active metabolites. A patient that received methadone for cancer-associated pain developed myoclonus as a side effect. This has rarely been reported before in the literature. The pathophysiology and management of myoclonus are discussed.",0,0
154,11414270,Succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia in a patient with mucositis secondary to chemotherapy.,"To report a case of fatal hyperkalemia owing to succinylcholine administration in a patient with mucositis secondary to chemotherapy.
Case report.
Adult intensive care unit (ICU) at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.
One patient with mucositis secondary to chemotherapy.
A 37-yr-old female with recently diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia was admitted to the ICU with mental status changes and progressive dyspnea requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Before ICU admission, the patient had suffered from painful mucositis causing severe dysphagia and bleeding, which was thought to be the result of chemotherapy. By the 10th ICU day, the patient's respiratory and mental status improved and the patient was successfully extubated. However, 8 hrs after extubation, she gradually developed severe respiratory distress, requiring reintubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient was given 14 mg of etomidate and 100 mg of succinylcholine intravenously. Immediately after the intubation, she suffered cardiac arrest. Her serum potassium level was 13.1 mEq/L and HCO3- was 16 mEq/L. The resuscitation attempt was unsuccessful, and the patient was pronounced dead.
Oral mucositis is a frequent and potentially severe complication of cancer chemotherapy. We believe that mucositis was a contributing factor to this case of fatal hyperkalemia after administration of succinylcholine, with a mechanism similar to that reported with thermal injury. Only nondepolarizing muscle relaxants should be used in patients who are at risk for mucositis. Mucositis should be added to the list of conditions in which succinylcholine is contraindicated.",2001,6
155,11424102,Cutaneous seeding after ultrasound-guided percutaneous ethanol injection for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Cutaneous seeding is a rare complication of interventional ultrasound procedures. We describe a case of needle-track cutaneous seeding of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after sonographically guided percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI). In our case, the seeding might have been related to the type of needle used and the multiple passes required to treat the liver lesion. Despite the risk of needle-track seeding, PEI remains useful in the treatment of HCC.",0,0
156,11428480,Adenosine-induced ventricular fibrillation.,"The use of adenosine has been suggested as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of wide ORS complex tachycardia. However, adenosine shortens the antegrade refractoriness of accessory atrioventricular connections and may cause acceleration of the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. We observed ventricular fibrillation in 2 patients who presented to the emergency department with pre-excited atrial fibrillation and were given 12 mg of adenosine.",0,0
157,11431864,Steroid-induced acute psychosis in a child with asthma: report of one case.,"A 5-year-old girl was admitted due to severe asthmatic attack. She was treated with methylprednisolone (40 mg i.v. q6h), aminophylline (loading with 5 mg/kg and maintained with 0.6 mg/kg/hr i.v. drip), nebulized terbutaline sulphate (5 mg q6h), oral procaterol 12.5 micrograms bid, along with oxygen therapy. Acute psychotic reaction with visual hallucination, delusion, panic reaction and myoclonic movement of hands developed on day 3 of admission. The patient had no previous history of psychiatric problems. The theophylline level was 9.89 micrograms/ml at the moment of psychotic reaction. After the dose of methylprednisolone was reduced from 40 mg to 20 mg i.v. q6h and shifted to other anti-asthma treatment by procaterol metered dose inhaler via spacer, the psychotic reaction disappeared a few hours later. The psychotic reaction was thought to be due to steroid therapy since no other causes could explain the psychotic reaction.",0,0
158,11435808,Continuous EEG monitoring in a patient with massive carbamazepine overdose.,"The authors report a woman who took a massive overdose (OD) of carbamazepine (CBZ). On admission she was unconscious with absent brainstem reflexes and multifocal stimulus-sensitive myoclonus. Continuous EEG recordings showed a burst-suppression pattern with bursts containing only generalized spikes accompanying myoclonic activity. Myoclonus and EEG bursts were both spontaneous and stimulus induced. With treatment, the serum CBZ concentration declined, and the EEG became more continuous and rhythmic without epileptiform discharges. Unfortunately, the patient died from adult respiratory distress syndrome. Autopsy revealed that cortical and subcortical structures were normal without neuronal necrosis or eosinophilia. Massive CBZ OD may produce a reversible encephalopathy that includes cortical hyperexcitability, a profound burst-suppression EEG pattern, and cranial nerve areflexia. Continuous EEG monitoring is helpful in managing seizures that occur as a complication of CBZ OD, after the course of recovery or worsening, and in providing assistance with prognosis.",2001,3
159,11443640,Massive plasmocytosis due to methimazole-induced bone marrow toxicity.,"Pancytopenia is a rare complication of the thionamide therapy reported secondary to aplastic anemia, the bone marrow being invariably hypocellular. We present a case of a 16-year-old female with Graves' disease who presented with massive bone marrow plasmocytosis mimicking multiple myeloma. The patient had already been on methimazole for a month when she was admitted to the Pediatric Unit with the diagnosis of sepsis. CBC revealed pancytopenia. Bone marrow aspirations showed hypocellular-normocellular bone marrow, 98% of plasma cells. At that time, MMI was discontinued and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, dexamethasone, and G-CSF. Bone marrow aspiration day +4 still showed hypo-normocellular marrow, with remaining 6% plasma cells. Myeloma screen was negative; ANC >1,000 at day +7, platelets >50,000 at day +24. Twenty-four months after patient's discharge, her clinical condition, CBC, and bone marrow remained normal. To our knowledge this is the first report of pancytopenia due to MMI, where the usual hypoplasia found is replaced by massive plasmocytosis.",2001,8
160,11450788,Antiretroviral-induced hepatic steatosis and lactic acidosis: case report and review of the literature.,"As the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection continues to rise the clinician is encountered with a diagnostic challenge. Nonsurgical diseases such as acute colitis or enteritis can appear similar to such true surgical emergencies as abscess, perforation, or mesenteric ischemia. We report a case of fulminant hepatic failure associated with didanosine and masquerading as a surgical abdomen and compare the clinical, biologic, histologic, and ultrastructural findings with reports described previously. This entity should be kept in mind when evaluating the acute abdomen in the HIV-positive patient.",2001,7
161,11452688,Avascular necrosis of bone: the hidden risk of glucocorticoids used as antiemetics in cancer chemotherapy.,The role of antiemetics is invaluable in allowing cancer patients to complete otherwise potentially intolerable chemotherapy. Corticosteroids have an established place in the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting due to emetogenic cytotoxic agents. Avascular necrosis of bone is a recognised complication of glucocorticoid treatment--the risk of this increasing with higher doses and longer duration of use. This report details a case of bilateral avascular necrosis of the femoral heads in a patient receiving 'standard' doses of dexamethasone as part of the antiemetic regimen used in cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.,2001,6
162,11468878,Digestive hemorrhage caused by a Meckel's diverticulum in a metformin-treated patient: is there any connection?,"An obese patient, not diabetic, treated with metformin for some weeks, was referred to us with severe inferior digestive hemorrhage, diagnosed with Meckel's diverticulum. Metformin is described as a glucose-lowering agent for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and as antiobesity drug, though results achieved with this last indication are not conclusive. But metformin has fibrinolytic features by means of diminished plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity. Although no coagulation study was done and the Meckel's diverticulum is normally associated with bleeding, the particular intensity of the following hemorrhage may have been favored by metformin.",2001,6
163,11476690,Serratia Marcescens corneal ulcer as a complication of orthokeratology.,"To report a case of Serratia Marcescens corneal ulcer as a complication of orthokeratology treatment.
Case report.
A 9-year-old male who underwent orthokeratology treatment for 6 months suffered from a corneal ulcer. The refractive state of lesion eye was -5.5D/-1.25D x 180 degrees, and visual acuity was hand motion at 30 cm. He wore a retainer lens, rigid gas permeable lens, overnight for 2 months before the corneal ulcer occurred. Ulcer became worse after tobramycin and gentamycin treatment for 2 days. After ciprofloxacin treatment, the ulcer healed and visual acuity recovered to 20/20 with spectacle correction. Cultures of the cornea tissue and contact lens storage solution both grew Serratia Marcescens, which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
Overnight wearing of a rigid contact lens is a risk factor for a corneal ulcer.",2001,8
164,11483161,Possible linkage of amprenavir with intracranial bleeding in an HIV-infected hemophiliac.,"The use of protease Inhibitors (PI) has been associated with many adverse effects including increased tendency to bleed, which is particularly problematic in individuals with congenital coagulation disorders. We report the occurrence of spontaneous intracranial bleeding in an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adolescent with hemophilia A who was receiving amprenavir (APV). The bleeding resolved on discontinuation of APV. This case report highlights a need for awareness of increased bleeding as a potentially serious complication associated with the use of all currently licensed PIs in individuals with hemophilia.",2001,7
165,11485141,Linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis induced by gemcitabine.,"To report a case of linear immunoglobulin (Ig) A bullous dermatosis (LABD) induced by gemcitabine.
A 59-year-old man was diagnosed with squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung in T4N2M0 stage and treated with cisplatin, vinorelbine, and gemcitabine. Twenty-four hours after the administration of gemcitabine, a symmetric, bullous, herpetiform eruption appeared on his trunk and upper limbs. Histopathologic examination and direct immunofluorescence test were consistent with IgA bullous dermatosis. Cutaneous lesions resolved two weeks after the drug was withdrawn and topical steroid treatment was instituted.
Drug-induced LABD is a variant of classic or idiopathic LABD. Vancomycin is the most frequently implicated drug, but other agents have been reported to cause LABD. According to the Naranjo probability scale, the relationship of gemcitabine treatment with cutaneous eruption in our patient is possible.
We report the first case of gemcitabine-induced LABD. Clinicians should monitor patients receiving this drug for signs of LABD.",0,0
166,11487721,A rare case of advanced ovarian carcinoma who developed difficulty walking 25 days after treatment with weekly paclitaxel.,"Although taxol has shown significant activity in advanced ovarian cancer, peripheral neuropathy is likely to become the major dose-limiting toxicity. We describe a case of advanced ovarian carcinoma who developed difficulty walking because of marked pain in the lower extremities and loss of proprioception 25 days after treatment with weekly taxol (80 mg/m(2)x3).",2001,8
167,11489400,Relief by naloxone of morphine-induced spasm of the sphincter of Oddi in a post-cholecystectomy patient.,"Spasm of the sphincter of Oddi is a well-recognized effect of the narcotic class of drugs. Although it is usually clinically silent, such spasm occasionally causes debilitating pain that may be mistaken for more serious disorders. We present the case of a patient who had undergone cholecystectomy previously, but in whom morphine given in the Emergency Department precipitated pain consistent with biliary colic; the pain resolved promptly after administration of naloxone. This entity may considered in the differential diagnosis of acute onset of colicky abdominal pain in the patient given narcotics.",2001,8
168,11506739,Myasthenia gravis during low-dose IFN-alpha therapy for chronic hepatitis C.,"We describe the case of a 56-year-old man who had high aminotransferase levels and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies. He underwent liver biopsy and biochemical screening to evaluate whether he would benefit from interferon (IFN) treatment. The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of HCV-related active chronic hepatitis, skin porphyria, and type 2 diabetes. On December 5, 1995, he began therapy with recombinant IFN-alpha at a dose of 3 MIU three times a week. He stopped this therapy in February 1996 because of asthenia, diplopia, headache, and anxiety. During IFN therapy, he had normal aminotransferase levels and no detectable HCV RNA, a condition that persists to the present. Between March and May 1996, the patient was admitted several times to a neurology clinic, where myasthenia gravis was diagnosed and treatment with pyridostigmine and cyclosporine was initiated. This case and others indicate that caution should be exercised in administering IFN because low doses can be correlated with myasthenia gravis in patients without malignancies.",2001,7
169,115078,Cholestatic hepatitis induced by gold.,A patient with rheumatoid arthritis developed an acute intrahepatic cholestasis after 100 mg of sodium aurothiomalate. Hepatotoxicity in rheumatoid arthritis is well described following a variety of anti-inflammatory preparations but is now a rare complication of gold therapy and the literature on the subject is reviewed.,1979,8
170,11510798,Acute lung injury associated with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatinum combined chemotherapy.,"Diarrhoea, T-CD4+ lymphopenia and bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates developed in a male 60 yrs of age, who was treated with oxaliplatinum and 5-fluorouracil for unresectable rectum carcinoma. The findings from transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were consistent with an organizing diffuse alveolar damage pattern. Once extensive microbiological studies proved negative, corticosteroids were given and a complete remission of clinical and radiological abnormalities was achieved. It is concluded that the aforementioned pathological manifestations were due to chemotherapy and included a pulmonary adverse reaction, a feature never previously associated with oxaliplatinum and 5-fluorouracil regimens.",2001,7
171,11514944,Continued occurrence of Accutane-exposed pregnancies.,"Accutane a teratogenic prescription drug licensed to treat severe, recalcitrant nodular acne. First-trimester pregnancy exposure can cause major birth defects. The manufacturer began a Pregnancy Prevention Program (PPP) in 1988; however, exposed pregnancies continue to occur. In 1996, the manufacturer began a direct-to-consumer advertising campaign, raising concerns of more exposed pregnancies.
We examined trends in Accutane use by reproductive-aged women. We also interviewed a series of 14 women in California who had recent Accutane-exposed pregnancies to identify opportunities for prevention.
The estimated number of Accutane prescriptions for reproductive-aged women has more than doubled in the past 10 years; it is the most widely used teratogenic drug in the United States, with approximately 2.5 per 1,000 reproductive-aged women exposed to Accutane in 1999. One-half of the women interviewed reported seeing an advertisement for prescription acne treatment before taking Accutane. Eight of the 14 women used no contraception at the time of the exposed pregnancy; 13 of the 14 women did not use two forms of contraception. Four of the 14 women did not have pregnancy tests before starting Accutane. None reported seeing all PPP components, and four saw only the information on the pill packet. These 14 pregnancies resulted in four live infants who had no apparent birth defects, one live-born infant with multiple defects, four spontaneous abortions, and five induced abortions.
The increase in Accutane use observed among females may be exacerbated by advertising. Physicians and patients must use more caution with teratogenic prescription drugs. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",2001,9
172,11518127,"Acute interstitial pneumonia induced by ONO-1078 (pranlukast), a leukotriene receptor antagonist.","A 62-year-old woman treated with pranlukast for 2 months developed interstitial pneumonitis with a high fever. A lymphocyte stimulation test was reactive to pranlukast. Her clinical symptoms improved with discontinuation of pranlukast and administration of systemic corticosteroid. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of drug-induced lung disease involving a leukotriene. The steps that can be taken to promptly reach a diagnosis and to successfully treat this life-threatening condition are described.",2001,8
173,11545487,Papillary necrosis associated with the HIV protease inhibitor indinavir.,The HIV protease inhibitor indinavir may cause nephrolithiasis and interstitial nephritis. The renal consequences of indinavir-associated nephrotoxicity are uncertain. We report a case of papillary necrosis in a patient treated with indinavir. An asymptomatic HIV-infected woman experienced right-sided renal colicky pain during treatment with indinavir. She passed a non-solid stone and continued indinavir treatment. Intravenous pyelogram performed 20 months later following an episode of left-sided colicky pain showed right-sided papillary necrosis. Indinavir-associated nephrolithiasis and chronic interstitial nephritis were the only possible causes identified in this patient. Physicians should be aware that indinavir nephrolithiasis may cause papillary necrosis.,2001,8
174,11550988,Nephrotoxicity of selective COX-2 inhibitors.,"We describe 2 male patients, a 49-year-old with psoriatic arthritis and impaired renal function and a 43-year-old renal transplant recipient, who both sustained a marked decline in glomerular filtration rate in conjunction with a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), rofecoxib. In the second patient, acute renal failure necessitated hemodialysis. Both patients made an uneventful recovery. Our report lends further support to the assumption that COX-2 inhibitors, as a class, can be as nephrotoxic as their nonselective predecessors. Therefore, COX-2 inhibitors should be used with caution in renal transplant recipients and in patients with salt depletion and renal insufficiency.",2001,9
175,11554897,Stupor from lamotrigine toxicity.,"To report that acute lamotrigine poisoning may result in severe encephalopathy.
A 55-year-old woman became stuporous after overdose with lamotrigine (LTG) and valproic acid (VPA) tablets. Evaluation revealed elevated serum LTG levels and no other etiology for encephalopathy.
LTG was withheld, and the patient experienced a complete recovery in conjunction with reduced serum levels.
LTG overdose may result in a severe but reversible encephalopathy, a previously undescribed phenomenon. LTG toxicity should be considered in patients taking this drug who have depressed mental status.",2001,8
176,11563738,Tissue distribution of olanzapine in a postmortem case.,"Olanzapine is a relatively new antipsychotic drug used in the United States for the treatment of schizophrenia. Since its release in the United States market in 1996, few cases of fatal acute intoxication have been reported in the literature. This article describes the case of a 25-year-old man found dead at home who had been prescribed olanzapine for schizophrenia. This case is unique because of the measurement of olanzapine in brain tissue obtained from seven regions in addition to the commonly collected biologic matrices. Olanzapine was detected and quantitated by basic liquid-liquid extraction followed by dual-column gas chromatographic analysis with nitrogen phosphorus detection. The assay had a limit of detection of 0.05 mg/L and an upper limit of linearity of 2 mg/L. The presence of olanzapine was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry by use of electron impact ionization. The concentrations of olanzapine measured in this case were as follows (mg/L or mg/kg): 0.40 (heart blood), 0.27 (carotid blood), 0.35 (urine), 0.61 (liver), negative (cerebrospinal fluid), 0.33 mg in 50 ml (gastric contents). In the brain, the following distribution of olanzapine was determined (mg/kg): negative (cerebellum), 0.22 (hippocampus), 0.86 (midbrain), 0.16 (amygdala), 0.39 (caudate/putamen), 0.17 (left frontal cortex), and 0.37 (right frontal cortex). The cause of death was determined to be acute intoxication by olanzapine, and the manner of death was accidental.",2001,9
177,11568758,Lichenoid drug eruption to salsalate.,"Cutaneous lichenoid eruptions can arise as a result of exogenous compound exposures. Pharmaceutical drugs, industrial compounds, and inhaled particles have been implicated as causative agents. To date, there have been no recorded cases of lichenoid drug eruptions (LDEs) caused by clinical use of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug salsalate. We describe a patient who experienced a lichenoid eruption after the initiation of salsalate for relief of arthritic pain. This eruption emerged after 1 month of therapy with salsalate, persisted for as long as salsalate was administered, and cleared within 3 weeks of discontinuing the medication. LDEs can clinically and histologically resemble idiopathic or classic lichen planus. Integrating drug history, clinical morphology, clinical distribution, and histopathology can aid in the differentiation. As in our patient's case, curative treatment for LDE requires discontinuation of the drug.",2001,10
178,11573852,Amphotericin B-induced seizures in a patient with AIDS.,"To report a case of multiple episodes of seizure activity in an AIDS patent following amphotericin B infusion.
A 46-year-old African-American man experienced recurrent grand mal seizures during intravenous infusion of amphotericin B, then petit mal seizures as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time. The patients concurrent medications included didanosine, hydroxyzine, promethazine, hydrocortisone, and prochlorperazine. Despite administration of phenytoin and lorazepam, the seizures persisted and occurred only during amphotercin B administration.
AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis, both of which the patient had, can potentially cause seizures. The patient had a history of alcohol abuse; alcohol intake as well as withdrawal can also cause seizures. Didanosine also has a potential for inducing seizures. However, these other potential causes of seizure were ruled out. The time course of events suggested that amphotericin B was the cause of the seizures in this AIDS patient.
Amphotericin B seems to be the probable cause of the seizures. To date, only three cases of seizures associated with amphotericin B have been reported in the literature, but healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for this rare adverse effect.",2001,9
179,11576059,Vocal cord paralysis as a consequence of peritonsillar infiltration with bupivacaine.,"Reduction of postoperative pain is an important goal in the perioperative management of tonsillectomy patients. This is particularly the case for children, who often exhibit resistance to intramuscular or rectal administration of drugs. Peritonsillar bupivacaine infiltration, a relatively safe method of pain control, is in some centers frequently used by otolaryngologists for pain relief. We present the case of a 5-year-old girl who developed bilateral vocal cord paralysis following preoperative peritonsillar bupivacaine infiltration. After an uneventful tonsillectomy and extubation, stridor and respiratory distress developed. Bilateral vocal cord paralysis was seen on laryngoscopy. The patient was reintubated and five hours later was successfully extubated without further sequelae. Anesthesiologists and surgeons should be aware of this uncommon complication than can occur with the use of peritonsillar bupivacaine infiltration for pain control in tonsil surgery.",2001,9
180,11590881,Carbamazepine induced right bundle branch block in a Greenlandic patient.,"A 53 year old Greenlandic male was admitted twice over a period of 4 years with a new complete right bundle branch block after ingestion of 10 g and 4 g of carbamazepine respectively. In both instances, reversion of intraventricular conduction to normal occurred within 72 hours, coinciding with clearance of carbamazepine from the blood stream. We recommend routine follow up by ECG of patients over the age of 50 treated with carbamazepine.",2001,8
181,11642488,Cicatricial entropion associated with chronic dipivefrin application.,"To report patients who presented to the oculoplastics department for repair of cicatrical entropion after topical use of dipivefrin. To discuss the possible mechanisms of action and highlight the potential detrimental effects of dipivefrin on palpebral conjunctiva.
Retrospective consecutive noncomparative case series. Nine eyes from 6 patients, 74 years to 90 years of age, referred by ophthalmologists for repair of cicatricial entropion after at least 2 years of twice-a-day application of dipivefrin.
After cessation of topical dipivefrin application and successful surgical repair of entropion, no recurrence of signs or symptoms has been reported. Moderate lymphocytic infiltration of the substantia propria of the conjunctiva of both upper and lower lid specimens was present, as was scarring and keratinization of the epithelium.
Cicatrization in the substantia propria of the conjunctiva by excessive lymphocytic infiltration after topically administered antiglaucoma drugs including dipivefrin is a possible mechanism of action for entropion.",2001,9
182,11672959,The 3-week sulphasalazine syndrome strikes again.,"A 34-year-old lady developed a constellation of dermatitis, fever, lymphadenopathy and hepatitis, beginning on the 17th day of a course of oral sulphasalazine for sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis. Cervical and inguinal lymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising lymphadenitis, associated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates, without viral inclusion bodies, suggestive of an adverse drug reaction.A week later, fulminant drug-induced hepatitis, associated with the presence of anti-nuclear autoantibodies (but not with other markers of autoimmunity), and accompanied by multi-organ failure and sepsis, supervened. She subsequently died some 5 weeks after the commencement of her drug therapy.Post-mortem examination showed evidence of massive hepatocellular necrosis, acute hypersensitivity myocarditis, focal acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis and extensive bone marrow necrosis, with no evidence of malignancy. It is thought that the clinico-pathological features and chronology of this case bore the hallmarks of the so-called ""3-week sulphasalazine syndrome"", a rare, but often fatal, immunoallergic reaction to sulphasalazine.",2001,11
183,11688826,Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH) following cisplatin administration in a pulmonary adenocarcinoma patient with a malignant pleural effusion.,"We report a patient with pulmonary adenocarcinoma complicated by the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) following systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) and vindesine (VDS). A 66-year-old woman was diagnosed as having pulmonary adenocarcinoma with malignant pleural effusion following investigations for cough and dyspnea. After drainage of the effusion she received combination chemotherapy with CDDP and VDS. She developed SIADH 48 hours following chemotherapy. Interestingly, the use of carboplatin (CBDCA) and VDS in the subsequent treatment course was well tolerated indicating that the SIADH was most likely to have been induced by administration of CDDP.",2001,10
184,11696132,Anisocoria from transdermal scopolamine.,"A transdermal scopolamine patch is an effective medication for relieving motion sickness, treating nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy and decreasing withdrawal side-effects from wearing off opioids. A 14-year-old boy with chronic granulomatous disease and severe infection was admitted to the hospital because of left shoulder aspergillus' infection and pain. The patient required high dose opioid to control the shoulder pain. A unilateral fixed and dilated pupil was noted. We assumed this to be related to the advancing central nervous system aspergillosis. After extensive neurological 'work up', we realized that the anisocoria was related to the transdermal scopolamine patch that we had prescribed for weaning off the opioid.",2001,0
185,11700998,De novo absence status of late onset following withdrawal of lorazepam: a case report.,The aim of this report is to describe the clinical and electroencephalographic findings seen in an elderly woman without previous history of seizures who developed a nonconvulsive generalized status epilepticus following acute withdrawal of lorazepam. Scalp video-EEG monitoring was obtained using the standard 10/20 system of electrode placement. Cognitive and speech functions were specifically tested during the evaluation. Continuous irregular rhythmic generalized 2.0-2.5 Hz sharp-and-slow wave complexes intermixed with spikes and polyspikes more prominent over the frontocentral areas were seen on the EEG. This epileptic activity was continuous and unmodified by sensory stimulation and eyes opening and closing. Intravenous injection of diazepam caused a rapid normalization of the EEG with disappearance of the clinical manifestations. De novo absence status is a specific epileptic condition that should be suspected in all elderly subjects on chronic treatment with psychotropic drugs presenting in a confusional state. An urgent EEG is essential to confirm the diagnosis.,2001,9
186,11703329,Early recognition of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type 1 can avoid life-threatening vincristine neurotoxicity.,"Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type 1 (HMSN-1) is an autosomal dominant disorder, which is usually not associated with neoplastic diseases. The disease predisposes to severe vincristine neurotoxicity. We report a 31-year-old women with recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma and unrecognized HMSN-1 who developed severe motor neuropathy 3 weeks after the first cycle of treatment including 2 mg of vincristine. HMSN is diagnosed in most cases retrospectively, usually suggested by the observation of foot abnormalities or family history. Recognizing early signs of HMSN, such as areflexia and pes cavus deformity, can prevent severe neurotoxicity of polychemotherapy by avoiding vincristine.",2001,11
187,11706664,Acute asymptomatic hepatitis in a healthy normal volunteer exposed to 2 oral doses of amodiaquine and artesunate.,Combination antimalarial therapy is being explored to delay development of resistance to falciparum malaria. This report describes an unexpected drug-induced hepatitis in a previously healthy young woman exposed to 2 doses of amodiaquine and artesunate. Use of these combinations should be closely monitored.,0,0
188,11712064,Systemic allergic contact dermatitis to 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP).,Photochemotherapy with psoralens and UVA (PUVA) is widely used in the treatment of psoriasis and many other skin conditions. Cutaneous adverse reactions to 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) appear to be rare and may be difficult to distinguish from phototoxicity or UV-induced polymorphic light eruption. We describe a patient who had a systemic allergic contact dermatitis to 8-MOP develop during her second course of PUVA treatment for psoriasis.,2001,12
189,11719751,Treatment of anticholinergic-induced ileus with neostigmine.,"A 33-year-old man with a history of recreational benztropine abuse presented to the emergency department with confusion, abdominal pain, and distention. An abdominal radiograph revealed gross fecal loading. He was initially treated with intravenous fluids and opiate analgesia. Subsequently, a diagnosis of anticholinergic poisoning was made, based on tachycardia, delirium, dry mucosa, and reduced bowel sounds. Treatment with tacrine reversed the delirium, and a history of repeated benztropine use was obtained. Persistent ileus was treated with repeated doses of neostigmine, and gastrointestinal motility returned with prompt defecation. Neostigmine appears to be useful in reversing ileus caused by anticholinergic drug overdose. Theoretically, it may be useful in reversing anticholinergic ileus resulting from acute drug overdose, allowing or enhancing decontamination, but the safety and potential efficacy of neostigmine in this scenario have not been established.",2001,12
190,11722307,Agranulocytosis and granulocytopenia associated with quetiapine.,"Quetiapine is a recently introduced atypical antipsychotic. Although adverse effects are mainly mild, more serious infrequent adverse effects including leucopenia are mentioned.
We describe three case-reports concerning haematological adverse effects of quetiapine.
Quetiapine was associated with leucopenia in two patients and clinically apparent agranulocytosis in one patient.
Although a definite association has not been proven, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of agranulocytosis while using quetiapine. Further post-marketing surveys are required.",2001,10
191,11724089,Ofloxacin: a probable cause of toxic epidermal necrolysis.,"To report a fatal case of toxic epidermal necrolysis in a man who was treated with oral ofloxacin for epididymitis.
A 75-year-old white man received 23.6 grams of ofloxacin over a 51-day period for epididymitis. He experienced a severe skin reaction diagnosed as toxic epidermal necrolysis. The man died from complications related to toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Toxic epidermal necrolysis is an infrequent, yet often fatal, severe, systemic, cutaneous disease most often the result of an adverse drug reaction. Fluoroquinolones have rarely been implicated in cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis. A MEDLINE search from 1966 to December 2000 revealed no reports of toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome due to ofloxacin therapy. However, a large case-control study included three cases of either Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with ofloxacin use, but no details of the cases were given. This report rules out other causes of toxic epidermal necrolysis and implicates ofloxacin in what appears to be an atypical presentation of drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis.
There is very little published information regarding ofloxacin-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. There are a few case reports of other fluoroquinolones that have been associated with toxic epidermal necrolysis. It is hoped that this case report creates awareness that ofloxacin-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis is possible.",2001,11
192,11737689,Neutrophilic dermatoses in two children with idiopathic neutropenia: association with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy.,"Painful neutrophilic skin lesions were observed in two children receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for treatment of idiopathic neutropenia. A girl with cystic fibrosis and cyclic neutropenia developed an erythematous papular eruption without fever or neutrophilia 7 months after commencing therapy with G-CSF. A skin biopsy specimen revealed microscopic, sterile, neutrophilic abscesses. A boy with chronic neutropenia and recurrent inflammatory skin lesions developed multiple erythematous nodules following administration of G-CSF. A biopsy specimen showed neutrophilic panniculitis. We believe that these skin eruptions belong to a spectrum of neutrophilic dermatoses that can be induced or aggravated by G-CSF therapy.",0,0

194,11749112,Visual fields and tiagabine: a quandary.,"This case report describes the development of asymptomatic visual field defects (VFDs) in a psychiatric patient with bipolar disorder receiving adjunctive tiagabine treatment. These defects were apparently reversible upon the discontinuation of tiagabine. Controlled clinical trials are indicated to determine if this finding is indicative of a class effect for all GABAergic antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), as already noted with vigabatrin, or if this case represents an incidental finding with tiagabine (41 references).",2001,10
195,11757641,Pulmonary toxicity with mefloquine.,"This report presents a case of acute lung injury developing within hours after administration of mefloquine for a low-level Plasmodium falciparum malaria, which was persistent despite halofantrine therapy. Extensive microbiological investigation remained negative and video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage. The evolution was favourable without treatment. This is the second report of acute lung injury and diffuse alveolar damage caused by mefloquine. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency was present in the former case and was thought to contribute to the lung injury. However, glucose-phosphate dehydrogenase was normal in the present case, suggesting that it is not a predisposing condition to the lung injury.",2001,11
196,11762672,Reversal of severe methanol-induced visual impairment: no evidence of retinal toxicity due to fomepizole.,"We report a case of methanol poisoning exhibiting complete recovery from severe visual impairment following treatment with ethanol, fomepizole, and hemodialysis. An adult male presented with central blindness after ingesting methanol. Initial visual acuity was <20/800 (finger counting at 1-2 feet) with retinal edema on fundoscopy, arterial pH 7.19, methanol 97 mg/dL (30 mmol/L), formate 14.3 mmol/L, and ethanol undetectable. The patient was treated with ethanol, then fomepizole intravenously (15, 10, then 5 mg/kg), and hemodialysis. Methanol metabolism was effectively blocked by fomepizole even after ethanol had been eliminated, and the patient recovered 20/20 vision by day 14 with normal fundoscopy. This case report confirms highly efficient inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase by fomepizole, as well as demonstrate the safety of fomepizole in a patient already exhibiting end-organ retinal toxicity. The potential for fomepizole to inhibit retinol dehydrogenase, an isoenzyme of alcohol dehydrogenase essential to vision, did not appear to be clinically significant in this symptomatic methanol-poisoned patient.",2001,0
197,11788010,Hepatolithiasis (intrahepatic stone) during octreotide therapy for acromegaly: a case report.,"We report a case of hepatolithiasis (intrahepatic stone) complicated by gram-negative sepsis in a 37 year old male with acromegaly being treated with octreotide. As a child, he had suffered a traumatic injury to his liver requiring the surgical repair of a laceration. This is the first reported case of hepatolithiasis during octreotide therapy. Gallstones and bile sludge are common side effects of octreotide therapy but rarely become symptomatic or require treatment. Hepatolithiasis is uncommon in western countries but is quite prevalent in East Asia and is often associated with a predisposing condition that causes intrahepatic bile stasis (eg. bile duct stricture). In addition to its known effect on gallbladder stasis, octreotide alters bile acid composition and may thus hasten intrahepatic sludge and stone formation. Extra caution should be taken in using octreotide or its long-acting analog in patients otherwise predisposed to intrahepatic bile stasis.",2000,12
198,11795358,The effect of SERMs on the endometrium.,"Tamoxifen, the first clinically available SERM, was developed in 1966 and approved by the FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) in 1978. It is the most prescribed antineoplastic drug in the world, with approximately 10 million women-use-years of experience. Tamoxifen has proved efficacious in all settings of breast cancer. However, in the mid-to-late 1980s, a series of letters to the editor and case reports announced an association between tamoxifen therapy in women with breast cancer and the development of endometrial carcinoma. Subsequently, in 1998, the observation of a significant 49% reduction in invasive breast cancer relative to placebo in a cohort of women at increased risk for the disease resulted in the early stopping of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project's (NSABP) P-1: Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT). Importantly, this was the first time that information became available about the effects of tamoxifen in healthy women, that is, women who did not already have breast cancer. In this healthy population, the relative risk of developing endometrial carcinoma in the tamoxifen arm was 2.54, although when stratified by age, in women over 50, the risk grew to 4.01. Thus, the risk appears to be confined to women over 50 because, in contrast, in women under 50 there was no statistically significant increase in the risk of endometrial carcinoma.",2001,12
199,11804071,Isonicotinic acid hydrazide induced anagen effluvium and associated lichenoid eruption.,"A 32 year-old woman developed generalised lichenoid eruptions on her body followed by diffuse loss of scalp hair of the anagen effluvium type. She was receiving several anti-tubercular drugs, including rifampicin, isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH), pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, for abdominal tuberculosis. INH, which is a leading cause of drug eruptions in the above group of drugs was withdrawn. However, the other antitubercular drugs were continued along with 40 mg of prednisolone in a single daily morning dose. The latter was discontinued slowly over a period of 10 weeks. There was complete recovery of hair loss and the regrowth started after 12 weeks of alopecia. Such anagen effluvium with lichenoid eruption following INH therapy has not been observed previously. The complete recovery from anagen effluvium is difficult to explain, but it could have been because of the early initiation of corticosteroid.",2001,12
200,11807466,Linear IgA bullous dermatosis occurring after carbamazepine.,"Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is an immunobullous disorder in which IgA antibodies are deposited within the basement membrane zone. The cause is unknown, but the eruption may occur in association with certain medications. We report a patient who experienced LABD shortly after starting carbamazepine therapy.",2002,2
201,11816261,Serotonin syndrome caused by selective serotonin reuptake-inhibitors-metoclopramide interaction.,"To report 2 cases of serotonin syndrome with serious extrapyramidal movement disorders occurring when metoclopramide was coadministered with sertraline or venlafaxine.
A 72-year-old white woman was treated with sertraline for depression for 18 months and was then admitted to the hospital with a fractured tibia. She was administered metoclopramide because of nausea and, within 2 hours, developed agitation, dysarthria, diaphoresis, and a movement disorder. These symptoms recurred following 2 subsequent administrations of metoclopramide. Treatment with diazepam led to resolution of symptoms within 6 hours, and there was no recurrence at 6 weeks' follow-up. A 32-year-old white woman with major depression was treated with venlafaxine for 3 years. She was admitted following a fall and, after being given metoclopramide, developed movement disorder and a period of unresponsiveness. After a second dose of metoclopramide, these symptoms recurred and were associated with confusion, agitation, fever, diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypertension. She improved with administration of diazepam, but needed repetition of this treatment over the next 16 hours. Symptoms resolved within 2 days, and she continued venlafaxine with no further adverse effects.
Both cases met Stembach's criteria for serotonin syndrome and had serious extrapyramidal movement disorders. The possible pathophysiologic mechanisms for the adverse reactions include a single-drug effect, a pharmacodynamic interaction, and a pharmacokinetic interaction. We believe that a pharmacodynamic interaction is most likely.
Clinicians should be aware of a risk of serotonin syndrome with serious extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving sertraline or venlafaxine when metoclopramide is coadministered even in a single, conventional dose.",2002,1
202,11819156,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in a patient with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.,"A patient suffering from a rare enzyme deficiency developed a malignant neuroleptic syndrome after having been treated with one single dose of haloperidol. We investigated the patient's serum for all frequent polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 2D6, assuming him to be a poor neuroleptic metabolizer. We will also discuss other potential mechanisms inducing this disturbance and its differential diagnoses.",2002,1
203,11834188,Dermatitis to captopril.,"reports on delated cutaneous reactions to captopril have been seldom reported. Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and their cutaneous side-effects are documented, but little has been published concerning the usefulness of patch test when they occur. We presented the case of a patient who developed a cutaneous reaction induced by captopril with positive patch test.
patch testing was performed with captopril, other ACE (enalapril, lisinopril ramipril), and European standard series. Following, we performed a double-blind oral challenge test with drugs who results was negative. Positive reaction were obtained to captopril at 4 days and the others test being negative. The same test were negative in five control patients. The patient tolerated enalapril, and lisinopril without problems.
the allergological studies confirmed sensitisation to captopril and tolerance to lisinopril, and enalapril. When patch test are performed with several drugs of the same family, results seem to indicate an absence of cross-sensitivity, but in several patients, oral provocation test were needed because patch test gave no conclusive information.",0,0
204,11837564,Warfarin-associated bleeding complication saved life.,"A 62-year-old Caucasian man with atrial fibrillation who was taking warfarin reported an episode of hematochezia; his international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.74. His weekly warfarin dose was increased by approximately 5%, and he was given three fecal occult blood cards. At follow-up 1 week later, the patient denied any episodes of hematochezia. His INR was 1.69 despite the increased warfarin dosage. One of the occult blood cards showed a positive result, and colonoscopy revealed a 5-cm lesion, identified as Dukes' A adenocarcinoma. Warfarin-associated bleeding generally is considered deleterious; however, in our patient it unmasked an early stage of colon cancer and thus may have saved the patient's life. Although minor gastrointestinal bleeding is common among patients taking anticoagulants, all patients should be fully evaluated because the source of hemorrhage may be malignant.",2002,2
205,11850606,A case of polymyositis with dilated cardiomyopathy associated with interferon alpha treatment for hepatitis B.,"Polymyositis is a rare complication of interferon alpha treatment as a result of immune-modulating role of the drug itself. In this case, interferon alpha induced polymyositis and cardiomyopathy is diagnosed in a 33-yr-old male patient with history of chronic hepatitis B. To treat hepatitis B, interferon alpha was administered until the proximal muscle weakness developed. Thereafter, sixteen cycles of immunoglobulin treatment (400 mg/kg) along with corticosteroids were instituted and led to an improvement in subjective symptoms with decreases in level of CPK and LDH. However, dilated cardiomyopathy has not improved in spite of the cessation of interferon treatment. Unlike the persistently elevated serum HBV DNA level, the serum ALT and AST levels have gradually decreased. Our case shows that clinical symptoms of polymyositis improved with steroid and immunoglobulin treatment without deterioration of the hepatitis B. To our knowledge, this is the first case of polymyositis associated with dilated cardiomyopathy after the administration of interferon in a patient with hepatitis B.",2002,2
206,11868077,Long-term follow-up after neoplastic seeding complicating percutaneous ethanol injection for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.,We describe a case of subcutaneous metastasis along the needle track after percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. After surgical resection and extrabeam radiation therapy the patient is alive without evidence of recurrence five years after PEI. One should pay attention to the abdominal wall around the needle track in interpreting CT or MR images of patients with previous PEI.,2002,1
207,11876387,Aggressive endometrial carcinoma in a breast cancer patient treated with tamoxifen with normal transvaginal ultrasonography. Case report.,"Since tamoxifen therapy can induce endometrial disorders, surveillance schemes of women taking tamoxifen have been recommended. Transvaginal ultrasonography is a very sensitive test and therefore is often performed as a first-line screening test. We described a very atypical case of a high stage, high grade endometrial cancer associated with tamoxifen in a 64-year-old woman with a past history of breast cancer. This women was assessed yearly by ultrasonography and Pap smear. The cancer developed on a very thin endometrium and transvaginal ultrasonography failed to detect it. The patient remained asymptomatic up to the diagnosis. Normal endometrial cells in the Pap smear test were the only signs associated with this cancer. Surveillance strategies and significance of endometrial cells on the Pap smear are reviewed. In conclusion, TVUS can fail to detect cancers if the endometrial lining is not enlarged. In case of normal endometrial cells in the Pap smear, a careful evaluation should be performed.",2002,0
208,11881322,Hepatotoxicity related to itraconazole: report of three cases.,"The antimycotic synthetic azole compounds are known to lead to toxic liver injury. The occurrence of acute hepatitis is best known for ketoconazole. With itraconazole, hepatotoxic reactions have only very rarely been reported, and histologic data are lacking. We report on three patients who developed acute liver damage during therapy with itraconazole, and in whom liver biopsy specimens were obtained.
Three patients with apparent itraconazole-induced liver injury were studied. Clinical, laboratory, serologic, and histologic data of all three cases were analyzed.
All three patients developed a biochemical-histologic pattern of cholestatic liver injury with damage to the interlobular bile ducts. Beginning ductopenia was present in two, suggesting that itraconazole might be responsible for the occurrence of prolonged drug-induced cholangiopathy. Jaundice was the presenting symptom in all three. It was not accompanied by clinical hallmarks of hypersensitivity, which is suggestive for metabolic rather than for immunoallergic idiosyncrasy.
Itraconazole-induced liver injury presents with a cholestatic pattern of injury with damage to the interlobular bile ducts, possibly leading to ductopenia. We suggest that itraconazole should be added to the list of drugs that may be responsible for a drug-induced vanishing bile duct syndrome. Further histologic documentation in other cases is necessary to strengthen our current findings.",0,0
209,11886466,Thrombotic stroke associated with the use of porcine factor VIII in a patient with acquired haemophilia.,"Porcine factor VIII (pFVIII), which is used to control bleeding in patients with congenital or acquired haemophilia who have high-titre neutralizing antibodies to human FVIII, is not known to increase the risk of arterial or venous thrombosis. We have recently encountered a patient with acquired haemophilia who developed a thrombotic left middle cerebral artery distribution stroke while being treated with pFVIII. To our knowledge, this is the first such reported thrombotic event. We speculate that platelet activation induced by pFVIII may have contributed to thrombosis and suggest that pFVIII be used with caution in elderly patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors.",2002,1
210,11903249,Cutaneous sarcoidosis during interferon alfa and ribavirin treatment of hepatitis C virus infection: two cases.,"Interferon-induced sarcoidosis is well documented. We report two new cases of sarcoidosis in two patients with hepatitis C virus infection treated with interferon alfa and ribavirin. These patients developed cutaneous sarcoidosis about 3 months after the beginning of the combination therapy. Spontaneous regression of the lesions was noted after discontinuation of the treatment. There have been more than 20 observations of the appearance or aggravation of this granulomatosis with interferon alfa and more recently with the combination of interferon alfa plus ribavirin. Dermatological signs are found in 50% of cases, and are often diagnostic. Other clinical symptoms of sarcoidosis resemble side-effects of interferon. The evolution is fairly stereotypical and is marked by a regression of the lesions following a dose reduction or curtailment of interferon. Interferon alfa acts by stimulating the T-helper (Th) 1 immune response. In addition to its antiviral action, ribavirin also enhances the Th1 response. Indeed, the superiority of the combination of interferon alfa and ribavirin in terms of antiviral action is corroborated by the enhancement of a Th1-type immune reaction by this combination. At the same time, this immune cell reaction triggers a greater granulomatous reaction.",2002,2
211,11918514,Severe serotonin syndrome induced by mirtazapine monotherapy.,"To document a case of serotonin syndrome (SS) associated with mirtazapine monotherapy, review the previously reported cases of SS associated with this tetracyclic antidepressant, and discuss the possible pathogenic mechanisms leading to this serious adverse drug reaction.
A 75-year-old man developed agitation, confusion, incoordination, and gait disturbance because of progressive rigidity. Mirtazapine had been started 8 days earlier to control major depression. Physical examination revealed diaphoresis, low-grade fever, hypertension, tachycardia, bilateral cogwheel rigidity, hyperreflexia, tremor, and myoclonus, symptoms and signs that are consistent with severe SS.
A review of the cases of SS with implication of mirtazapine as the cause was performed. The possible pathogenic mechanisms leading to this adverse reaction in this patient are also discussed, and pathophysiologic hypotheses are formulated.
Although mirtazapine offers clinicians a combination of strong efficacy and good safety, we suggest bearing SS in mind when prescribing this drug, especially in frail, elderly patients with underlying chronic conditions. In these patients, it might be more adequate to start mirtazapine therapy at a lower dose (<15 mg/d).",2002,4
212,11943900,Pulmonary toxicity secondary to procarbazine.,"Procarbazine is a chemotherapy methylating agent that has been used in combination with other drugs, perhaps most successfully in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease. There are several side effects that it is commonly associated with; however, it has only rarely been reported to cause lung injury. The resulting pneumonitis may be severe and irreversible. There are eight reported cases in the literature. Here, we report another such case.",2002,4
213,11961411,Minimal change nephrotic syndrome developing during postoperative interferon-beta therapy for malignant melanoma.,A 64-year-old man presented with proteinuria during postoperative interferon (IFN)-beta therapy against malignant melanoma. Renal pathologic findings were consistent with minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) showing extensive foot process effacement of visceral glomerular epithelial cells (podocyte). Nephrotic range proteinuria gradually regressed after stoppage of local injection of IFN-beta without glucocorticoid treatment. To our knowledge this is the first report that demonstrates histological abnormalities of the glomerulus associated with postoperative IFN-beta therapy for the malignant melanoma.,2002,4
214,11972105,Interaction between methotrexate and ciprofloxacin.,"High-dose methotrexate is used in malignant hemopathies and solid tumors in children. Methotrexate serum concentrations must be monitored because of the possible toxicity of drug elimination delay. Several drugs (e.g., penicillin, probenecid) can alter the elimination of methotrexate. The authors report two cases of delayed elimination of methotrexate in patients receiving ciprofloxacin, with severe toxicity.",2002,5
215,11978156,Lansoprazole-induced thrombocytopenia.,"To describe a case of thrombocytopenia associated with the administration of lansoprazole.
An 85-year-old white man presented with an upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage from a gastric ulcer. His platelet count was normal on admission. He was started on oral lansoprazole 60 mg twice daily and, on hospital day 2, his platelet count decreased to 102 x 10(3)/mm(3); on hospital day 3, the platelet count was 36 x 10(3)/mm(3). Lansoprazole was discontinued, and the platelet count returned to normal. He has not had any further episodes of thrombocytopenia to date.
After exclusion of other causes, the onset of thrombocytopenia after administration of lansoprazole, the resolution of the adverse reaction after discontinuation of the drug, and the fact that no other medicines were introduced during this time frame lead us to believe that this was most likely an idiosyncratic thrombocytopenic response to lansoprazole. To date, this is the first reported case of what appears to be isolated thrombocytopenia associated with lansoprazole.
Clinicians should be aware of the possible association of thrombocytopenia with lansoprazole and discontinue the drug if thrombocytopenia becomes apparent.",2002,5
216,11984077,Life-threatening anaphylactoid reaction to amifostine used with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for nasopharyngeal cancer in a patient with dermatomyositis: a case report with literature review.,"Dermatomyositis is associated with malignancy in approximately 20-25% of cases. The most common associated cancers are ovarian, lung, pancreatic, stomach, colon and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Nasopharyngeal cancer is not common in the Caucasian population; however, there is a much higher incidence in Asian patients. Radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for early nasopharyngeal cancer, but combination chemoradiotherapy is becoming more common for patients with advanced disease since the Intergroup trial 0099 demonstrated improved progression-free survival and overall survival for chemoradiotherapy. Increasingly, the cytotoxic agent amifostine is being used prior to radiotherapy in an attempt to decrease associated morbidities. Amifostine has been found to significantly decrease acute and chronic xerostomia but not mucositis. It appears to be selectively protective to salivary glands and kidneys without being tumor protective. The most common side effects associated with amifostine are nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypocalcemia and allergic reactions. We describe the case of a man with dermatomyositis and stage IV nasopharyngeal cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy and s.c. amifostine. The patient suffered a life-threatening anaphylactoid reaction to amifostine.",2002,3
217,11999915,Agranulocytosis during clozapine therapy.,"Granulocytopenia and agranulocytosis are considered among the most dangerous adverse effects of clozapine. During the last 15-year period, this atypical antipsychotic agent has been administered to 750 patients managed at the Emergency Psychiatry Services and Clinical Pharmacology Unit of the National Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology (NIPandN; Budapest, Hungary). Granulocytopenia was ascertained in seven, whereas agranulocytosis was diagnosed in two patients of this population. The latter two comprised a 42-year-old female with schizoaffective psychosis and a 35-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia. The female patient received clozapine in a daily dose of 400 mg, which induced agranulocytosis after 2 months. The male patient was treated with 225-mg/day clozapine and the time to the diagnosis of agranulocytosis was 6 weeks. These adverse reactions were recognized early and the appropriate treatment of agranulocytosis resulted in complete recovery in both cases.",2002,4
218,12013364,Atypical neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with olanzapine.,"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially life-threatening adverse effect of antipsychotic agents. It generally is characterized by fever, altered mental status, rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction. A 53-year-old man developed NMS without rigidity while taking olanzapine. Such atypical cases may support either a spectrum concept of NMS or the theory that NMS secondary to atypical antipsychotics differs from that caused by conventional neuroleptics. More flexible diagnostic criteria than currently mandated by the the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Revision, may be warranted.",2002,5
219,12022905,Priapism associated with zuclopenthixol.,"To present a single case of zuclopenthixol-induced priapism and a literature review.
We report the case of a 31-year-old patient hospitalized due to behavioral alterations and treated with oral zuclopenthixol, an antipsychotic from the thioxanthene family, who developed an acute, painful erection.
The occurrence of priapism in our patient was related to zuclopenthixol. This adverse reaction is reported for the first time in a patient not concomitantly treated with other drugs associated with the appearance of priapism. The capacity of zuclopenthixol to induce priapism is thought to be due to its antagonist activity on alpha-adrenergic receptors.
Priapism is an uncommon but potentially serious adverse effect of zuclopenthixol that practitioners, as with many other antipsychotics, should be aware of.",2002,6
220,12042592,Metamizole use by Latino immigrants: a common and potentially harmful home remedy.,"A 4-year-old boy presented with fever, septic arthritis, and persistent neutropenia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed no evidence of neoplasia. Additional history disclosed that the patient had been given metamizole for pain before onset of his illness. Metamizole, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent, is prohibited in the United States because of the risk of agranulocytosis but is widely used in Mexico and other countries. The increasing number of Latinos in the United States and the extensive cross-border transfer of medicines raise concerns that metamizole use and associated complications may become more frequent. After identification of the index patient, additional inquiry revealed that the patient's mother was hospitalized previously for overwhelming sepsis associated with metamizole use. These cases prompted an investigation of metamizole use in an urban pediatric clinic, which revealed that 35% of Spanish-speaking Latino families had used metamizole; 25% of these families had purchased the medication in the United States. We conclude that metamizole use is common and may be underrecognized in immigrant Latino patients. Physicians in the United States, especially those who practice primary care, hematology/oncology, and infectious diseases, must be aware of the availability and use of metamizole in specific patient populations and its potential for harmful side effects.",2002,6
221,12053072,Erythropoietin is beneficial in mitomycin-induced hemolytic-uremic syndrome.,"Mitomycin C is a powerful antineoplastic agent. If used at high dosage, it may cause a secondary form of adult hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Blood transfusions worsen the evolution of this peculiar form of HUS. We describe a patient who developed HUS after treatment with mitomycin C (total dose 144 mg/m2) due to a carcinoma of the ascending colon. Repeated blood transfusions were associated with rapidly evolving renal failure coupled with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Haptoglobin was undetectable. Soon after starting subcutaneous erythropoietin, the velocity of progression of renal failure slowed whilst no more blood transfusions were required and haptoglobin levels returned to normal. Thereafter, the patient's renal function slowly worsened and she started chronic hemodialysis 5 years later. Up to now, all investigations have failed to show a relapse of her adenocarcinoma. A possible explanation of these data is that erythropoietin permitted the termination of blood transfusions which both triggered and perpetuated the syndrome.

222,12066972,Levofloxacin-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis in an elderly patient.,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are mild-to-life-threatening adverse reactions that have been described after exposure to fluoroquinolones. No published reports, however, exist of exfoliative disease after treatment with levofloxacin. A 78-year-old woman with many medical problems, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, was treated with parenteral levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia. She was discharged with oral levofloxacin to complete an additional 3 days of treatment as an outpatient. Two days after completing this regimen, the patient developed a rash with blistering. The rash progressed to TEN in 7 days, and she was transferred to a burn treatment center. She was treated with fluid resuscitation, wound dressing, and antibiotics. Her condition improved, and she was discharged after 22 days. To our knowledge, this case is the first published report of levofloxacin-induced TEN.",2002,6
223,12078977,"Posterior leukoencephalopathy following cisplatin, bleomycin and vinblastine therapy for germ cell tumor of the ovary.","A 31-year-old female developed multiple episodes of grand mal seizures after combination chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine and bleomycin for germ cell ovarian cancer stage Ic. The clinicoradiologic features in this patient were consistent with posterior leukoencephalopathy, which is a rare complication of chemotherapy. Seizures were controlled by the anticonvulsive agent Dilantin (Pfizer, Khet Klongtoey, Bangkok) and she returned home without any permanent neurologic deficits. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging 2 weeks later showed complete resolution of the abnormalities. This syndrome has been previously reported following cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Physicians should remain alert to the potential hazards of chemotherapy to the central nervous system. Risks and benefits should be seriously considered before starting treatment.",2002,4
224,12086549,Toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with interleukin-2.,"Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) has been characteristically unresponsive to chemotherapy. In lieu of an effective regimen, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon alfa are considered drugs of choice to treat this cancer. Subcutaneous IL-2 is safe and well tolerated, with a mortality rate <3%.
To report a case of cutaneous and hematologic toxicity in a patient treated with IL-2.
A 67-year-old woman received radiotherapy and immunotherapy for cancer that had metastasized to the bone and lungs. IL-2 was part of the regimen. After 5 days of treatment with IL-2, the patient developed a hemorrhagic lesion that progressed to toxic epidermal necrolysis, as well as grade 4 pancytopenia. She died 10 days after treatment was begun. At the time of death, leukocytes were 0.3 x 10(3)/mm(3), platelets 10 x 10(3)/mm(3), and hemoglobin 6.8 mg/dL.
Cutaneous IL-2 adverse effects are frequent, but generally mild and reversible. The adverse hematologic effects are usually transitory and pancytopenia is not frequent. The severity of cutaneous and hematologic toxicity experienced by our patient has rarely been reported.
The use of IL-2 in bedridden patients with performance status >2 must be given on an individualized basis. If radiotherapy over extensive areas of the body is needed, the use of IL-2 must be postponed until radiotherapy is completed.",0,0

227,12100953,Leiomyosarcoma in urinary bladder after cyclophosphamide therapy for retinoblastoma and review of bladder sarcomas.,We report an unusual case of a leiomyosarcoma of the urinary bladder after chemotherapy for retinoblastoma and the results of a review of the published reports of bladder sarcomas. A 22-year-old man presented with hematuria and was found to have a mass in his urinary bladder on computed tomography. Transurethral resection of the mass revealed a leiomyosarcoma. The patient underwent radical cystectomy and an ileal conduit was created. The final pathologic examination confirmed high-grade leiomyosarcoma. Prospective randomized combination trials similar to the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study in the pediatric population are necessary to better understand and manage these potentially curable sarcomas.,2002,7
228,12107858,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to atypical neuroleptics: three episodes in one patient.,"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare, but potentially lethal complication of antipsychotic medication. The risk of developing NMS under atypical neuroleptics seems lower than under typical neuroleptics. However, the use of atypical neuroleptics in modern psychopharmacotherapy is increasing, so the incidence of NMS under these drugs may also increase. Here, we will describe three episodes of NMS that fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for NMS (APA, 1994). The epivodes of NMS occured under treatment with clozapine, risperidone, and amisulpride. These episodes had some atypical features that will be discussed with regard to the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to NMS.",2002,5
229,12111771,Multiple pulmonary nodules: an unusual presentation of fludarabine pulmonary toxicity: case report and review of literature.,"Fludarabine monophosphate, a purine analogue is used in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. A 73-year-old woman presented with fever and cough 2 weeks after completing the third cycle of fludarabine for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Chest roentgenogram showed multiple pulmonary nodules. Pulmonary histopathology demonstrated a mononuclear interstitial infiltrate without evidence of malignant, infectious, granulomatous, or vascular causes. Her symptoms and pulmonary nodules resolved following treatment with corticosteroids. To our knowledge, four cases of interstitial pneumonitis associated with fludarabine have been reported in medical literature. Fludarabine induced lung toxicity must be considered in all patients who develop unexplained lung disease while receiving fludarabine. It is reversible with discontinuation of drug and administration of corticosteroids. This case extends the spectrum of fludarabine pulmonary toxicity to include pulmonary nodules.",2002,7
230,12114387,Severe erythroderma as a complication of continuous epoprostenol therapy.,"Epoprostenol is a vasodilator that is produced by vascular endothelial cells and is currently the ""gold standard"" therapy for patients with severe primary pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary hypertension secondary to collagen vascular disease. Hypersensitivity to the drug has not been reported. We report a case of a patient with pulmonary hypertension and undifferentiated connective tissue disease who, after 2 months of treatment with epoprostenol, presented with rapidly progressive erythema, scaling, nausea and vomiting, and fever. Test results from a skin biopsy specimen were consistent with a drug reaction. The patient' condition improved after rapid tapering of her epoprostenol and administration of corticosteroids. Epoprostenol may be associated rarely with severe erythroderma.",2002,7
231,12121061,Ticlopidine-induced marrow aplasia treated with cyclosporine.,"A 50-year-old diabetic and hypertensive male patient is reported who had ticlopidine-induced marrow aplasia partially responsive to colony-stimulating factors and corticosteroids, but experienced complete recovery with cyclosporine. There is no consensus on the treatment of ticlopidine-induced marrow aplasia. Although many cases are reported to recover with colony-stimulating factors and corticosteroids, others are unresponsive or partially responsive. Our patient also did not completely respond to these medications, but was successfully treated with cyclosporine alone. Alone or in combination with corticosteroids, cyclosporine is an effective drug of choice for the resistant patients.",2002,4
232,12126225,Thiazolidinedione-induced edema.,"Edema is an adverse event associated with thiazolidinedione therapy The potential for mild-to-moderate peripheral edema with thiazolidinedione is known, especially in patients who have heart failure or use insulin. Our experience reveals that patients who do not have heart failure or do not use insulin also can develop moderate-to-severe edema that necessitates discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. A 77-year-old man developed ankle, hand, and facial swelling 2 weeks after starting rosiglitazone. After discontinuing the drug, his edema resolved. A 75-year-old man developed bilateral lower leg edema 6 months after switching from troglitazone to pioglitazone. He was hospitalized for 51 days and, after aggressive diuresis and discontinuation of pioglitazone, was discharged with a weight loss of 30 pounds. A 53-year-old man developed lower leg edema 4 weeks after rosiglitazone was increased from 4 mg once/day to 4 mg twice/day. Rosiglitazone was discontinued and the edema resolved. Until the mechanism of action responsible for fluid overload is known, we suggest that thiazolidinediones be administered with caution in all patients.",2002,7
233,12135176,Two cases of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia induced by the administration of verapamil against paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.,"Verapamil is widely used for the termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) with little proarrhythmic effect. We describe two cases of PSVT that changed to non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia after administration of verapamil. Electrophysiological study revealed atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia in the first case, and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia due to a concealed left lateral accessory pathway in the second case. Catecholamine-induced automaticity was one of the possible mechanisms of VT in the first case, but the mechanism is unknown in the second case.",2002,6

236,12153007,Myelodysplasia terminating in acute myeloid leukemia in a hairy cell leukemia patient treated with 2-deoxycoformycin.,"Purine analogs are effective in the treatment of several chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLPD) including hairy cell leukemia (HCL). To date, little evidence exists that these drugs are oncogenic. We report a case of HCL in a 66-year-old male treated with 2-deoxycoformycin. Just over 1 year following completion of his treatment, falling platelet and white cell counts were associated with the development of dysplastic features in his bone marrow and a rising blast cell count, culminating in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To the best of our knowledge only two previous cases of AML have been linked to treatment of HCL with purine analogs, both with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. We emphasize the need for long term follow up of patients treated with purine analogs and suggest that even those who are apparently cured be monitored periodically.",2002,6

Case report.
Medical intensive care unit at the University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.
A 46-yr-old female with ventilator-dependent, proliferative-phase acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia and sepsis.
A patient recovering from acute respiratory distress syndrome developed septic shock from Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia while in the medical intensive care unit. Vasopressin (0.04 units/min) was administered through a peripheral venous catheter for hypotension unresponsive to exogenous catecholamines. The patient subsequently developed severe ischemic necrosis of the skin and soft tissue surrounding the catheter site. The vasopressin was stopped, and the skin lesion progressed to bullae formation with extensive superficial erosion.
Peripheral administration of low-dose vasopressin for septic shock should be discouraged because of the risk of ischemic skin complications.",2002,8

Although vasculitis has been reported in the course of hairy cell leukaemia, it has only rarely been reported as the consequence of cladribine treatment. We describe a 73-year-old woman who developed serious systemic vasculitis with associated thrombocytopenia in the course of treatment with cladribine.",2002,8
240,12187348,Gigantomastia induced by bucillamine.,"Drug-induced mammary hyperplasias have been reported as rare complications of D-penicillamine and Neothetazone. The authors report the first case of bucillamine-induced giant mammary hyperplasia. Bucillamine is used as an antirheumatic drug that is structurally analogous to D-penicillamine. A 25-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis for the past 5 years started to develop gradual enlargement of her breasts 15 months before presentation. She had been on a combined treatment of steroid and lobenzarit disodium for the first 3 years, and then continued with a combined treatment of steroid and bucillamine for the following years until she was found to have pulmonary tuberculosis, at which time the steroid was suspended 10 months before she visited the authors' clinic. An almost total breast reduction was performed; 5 kg of right breast tissue and 7 kg of left breast tissue were excised. Retrospectively, bucillamine was believed to be the cause of the giant hypertrophy because of its structural similarity to D-penicillamine, which was the subject of an abundance of reports of mammary hyperplasia.",2002,8
241,12196666,Valproate embryopathy in three sets of siblings: further proof of hereditary susceptibility.,"The fetal valproate syndrome (FVS) is characterized by distinctive facial appearance, major and minor malformations, and developmental delay. Generally, only a small proportion of prenatally exposed children are affected. The authors describe three families in whom the occurrence of FVS in all the siblings strongly suggests hereditary susceptibility to valproic acid-induced adverse outcome. The risk for recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy may be high and should be taken into account in the counseling of parents and in considering drug treatment.",2002,8
242,12218252,Generalised pustular psoriasis induced by cyclosporin a withdrawal responding to the tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor etanercept.,"We report a 50-year-old male patient with a 15-year history of psoriasis including mutilating psoriatic arthritis, in whom the withdrawal of cyclosporin A induced a generalised pustular exacerbation and a aggravation of the joint condition. Two weekly injections of 25 mg of the tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor etanercept led to a rapid improvement of his psoriatic arthritis, as well as regression of the pustular eruption, while residual erythema was still present. The clinical response was reflected by an increase in circulating interleukin (IL) 10 and a decrease in IL-6 and IL-8 serum levels during treatment. We conclude that etanercept may be a safe and effective therapy not only in severe psoriatic arthritis, but also in cases of pustular rebound after withdrawal of immunosuppressive agents.",2002,0
243,12221670,"Ticlopidine-induced aplastic anemia: two new case reports, review, and meta-analysis of 55 additional cases.","Ticlopidine-induced aplastic anemia (TIAA) is considered very uncommon. We present two new cases, and we review 55 additional cases from the literature. The first case concerns a 70-year-old man who developed severe aplastic anemia 7 weeks after treatment with 500 mg of ticlopidine daily. The patient sustained a severe septic episode, was treated with antibiotics and GM-CSF, and recovered the 14(th) day after ticlopidine withdrawal. The second was an 82-year-old man receiving ticlopidine for 2 years when, during a febrile episode, he was found neutropenic with marrow aplasia. Ticlopidine withdrawal and treatment with antibiotics, transfusions, and G-CSF helped him to recover. When the data of the 57 patients are evaluated, a reversible direct cytotoxic effect of ticlopidine on the pluripotent/bipotent hematopoietic progenitor stem cell is proposed. It is estimated that the real incidence if TIAA is higher, and many cases, initially presented as agranulocytosis +/- thrombocytopenia, might be true aplastic anemias, not proven by marrow aspiration or trephine biopsy. There is no effective monitoring to prevent this side effect. Recombinant growth factors appear not to help in shortening the neutropenic period.",2002,9

245,122410,Transient TRH deficiency after prolonged thyroid hormone therapy.,"A patient who had been treated with large doses of thyroid hormone for several years developed features of secondary hypothyroidism after thyroid hormone withdrawal. These findings were low serum T4 (3.8 micrograms/dl), T3 (23 ng/dl), and a failure of serum TSH to rise after TRH injection. Serum PRL values rose normally after TRH administration, and evaluation of other pituitary hormones was normal. When retested 3 months later, at which time the serum T4 was 5.5 micrograms/dl, the patient was somewhat less hypothyroid and there was an exaggerated TSH response to exogenous TRH, indicating recovery of pituitary TSH reserve. Indirect assessment of endogenous TRH reserve capacity was consistent with impairment of endogenous TRH activity. Repeat studies performed 7 months later indicated some improvements in this indirect assessment of endogenous TRH reserve capacity but a continued exaggerated TSH response to exogenous TRH administration. Further testing at 28 months revealed a serum T4 value of 7.8 micrograms/dl and a serum T3 value of 141 ng/dl. At this time, the TSH response to TRH was normal and the patient was considered fully recovered. A causal relationship between high doses of thyroid hormone and the presumptive impairment of endogenous TRH reserve is suggested.",1978,9
246,12324937,Gemcitabine-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome.,"Gemcitabine has mild renal toxicity, but cases of gemcitabine-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) have been reported.
A case is presented of a 45-year-old woman on prolonged gemcitabine treatment for ovarian cancer who developed HUS and recovered after drug discontinuation. A mini-review of the literature based on a MEDLINE search follows.
Including our own patient, a total of 26 cases of gemcitabine-associated HUS were identified. Median patient age was 52 years. Treatment was for various tumors at advanced stages, and in some patients, other anticancer drugs previously had been administered. Mean time between initiation of gemcitabine therapy and onset of HUS was 7.4 +/- 3.5 months, or 21.9 +/- 10.9 doses of gemcitabine. The calculated median cumulative dose of gemcitabine was 20,000 mg/m(2) (range, 2,450 to 48,000 mg/m(2), or a total of 70,000 mg). The onset of disease was noted up to 2 months after the last gemcitabine infusion. Diagnosis of HUS was confirmed histologically in 13 patients and based on clinical findings in the other 15. Treatment included drug discontinuation, steroids, fresh frozen plasma, hemodialysis, absorption chromatography, plasmapheresis, and various combinations thereof. Of 23 patients with reported outcome, 11 died within a few weeks. In two cases, death was believed to be a direct consequence of HUS. Reexposure to the drug was reported in three patients but was uncomplicated in only one.
There are only a few confirmed cases of gemcitabine-associated HUS despite the widespread use of the drug. This potentially fatal complication is difficult to treat and should be widely known.",2002,10
247,12365708,Visual changes secondary to initiation of amiodarone: a case report and review involving ocular management in cardiac polypharmacy.,"Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative used to treat cardiac arrhythmias. The most-common ocular symptom is colored rings around lights. Common ocular findings include comeal micro-deposits and lens opacities. An amiodarone optic neuropathy has been described. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used to treat cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. It is known to cause dyschromatopsia, visual disturbances, and visual-field defects. Digoxin serum levels and toxicity risks increase with the addition of amiodarone.
Soon after initiation of amiodarone HCl (200 mg/day), a 76-year-old man came to us with symptoms of visual ""shining,"" glare, color vision anomalies, and gradually decreased vision. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 O.D. and 20/60 O.S. Ishihara color plates showed a marked, acquired color vision defect O.D., O.S. Biomicroscopy revealed amiodarone corneal deposits. The optic nerve appeared healthy, with no visible swelling in each eye. Amiodarone was discontinued after discussion with the cardiologist. On followup, the patient reported disappearance of symptoms. Visual acuity had improved to 20/30(+2) O.D. and 20/30 O.S. Ishihara color plates showed normal color vision.
As the elderly population and the incidence of heart disease increase in the United States, more people will probably be using heart drug therapy. Our case presents some of the challenges involved with managing ocular toxicity of these cardiac drugs. While both amiodarone and digoxin can cause permanent visual changes, the ocular effects are often reversible. Therefore, ocular examination at baseline and every 6 months is indicated for patients receiving a regimen of amiodarone and/or digoxin therapy.",2002,2
248,1238016,Benzalkonium chloride poisoning in infant twins.,Infant twins sustained severe circumoral and pharyngeal burns from a concentrated solution of benzalkonium (Zephiran) chloride prescribed for treatment of candidiasis. This report emphasizes the unnecessary hazard accompanying use of a potentially toxic drug-especially when prepared in error by the pharmacist-when a safer drug (nystatin) is available for treatment of oral candidiasis. Risks from use of a prescription drug for other than the intended patient are also highlighted by this episode of poisoning.,1975,10
249,12390172,Retinal dysfunction and anterior segment deposits in a patient treated with rifabutin.,"To describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings in a young boy with decreased vision possibly due to retinal damage by rifabutin.
An 8-year-old boy with osteomyelitis was referred due to visual disturbance. During a period of 4 years, the boy was examined six times with electroretinography. Ophthalmological examination included testing of visual acuity, slit-lamp inspection, fundus inspection, fundus photography and kinetic perimetry. Two electrophysiological methods were performed for objective evaluation of retinal function, namely full-field electroretinography and multifocal electroretinography.
We found a slightly reduced visual acuity, a slowly increasing amount of yellow-white deposits on the posterior surface of the cornea and on the anterior part of the lens, a normal fundus appearance, and normal visual fields. However, the electroretinogram was abnormal on several occasions during therapy with rifabutin, but returned to normal 3 months after withdrawal of the medication. The multifocal electroretinogram returned to normal after the full-field electroretinogram had done so. The anterior chamber deposits still remain.
Long-term treatment with rifabutin may have a reversible and previously undescribed side-effect on retinal function. The drug may also accumulate irreversibly on the posterior surface of the cornea and on the anterior surface of the lens. We suggest that objective evaluation of retinal function with electrophysiological methods should be performed in patients with visual disturbance during treatment with rifabutin.",2002,10
250,12397859,Pharmacokinetically induced benzodiazepine withdrawal.,"Pharmacokinetic interactions between medications can have clinically significant effects. Concern usually arises when a medication is added to a continuing regimen, though discontinuation of a medication can also have an impact. A case is presented of a patient who experienced benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of nefazodone, an antidepressant that inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme. Plasma levels of alprazolam, a substrate for the 3A4 isozyme, fell rapidly when nefazodone was discontinued, presumably because of renewed 3A4 isoenzyme activity. The management of the patient's withdrawal symptoms is described.",2001,0
251,12399645,A case of SIADH induced by mizoribin administration.,"We describe a 74-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who developed syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) 1.5 months after commencement of mizoribin prescription when his arthritis was improved. He noticed nausea and headache and serum Na fell as low as 118 mEq/l. Normal urinary Na excretion without hypotension or hemoconcentration negated the possibility of dehydration resulting from urinary Na loss. Serum antidiuretic hormone (ADH) remained elevated at 0.59 pg/ml in spite of a significant reduction in serum osmolality to 254 mosm/kg. He had no organic disease likely to cause SIADH. Despite infusion of hypertonic saline, his serum Na was not restored to normal. Shortly after mizoribin withdrawal, his serum Na increased significantly from 128 to 139 mEq/l and plasma osmolality from 265 to 287 mosm/kg. ADH hypersecretion in relation to plasma osmolality was reversed by mizoribin withdrawal, suggesting that bredinin might adversely induce SIADH. Additional predisposing factors were the patient's age and difficulty in urination due to benign prostatic hypertrophy. In summary, we report herein the first case of SIADH believed to be an adverse effect of mizoribin, which may therefore needed to be added to the list of drugs which can induce SIADH.",2002,12

253,12424571,Acute onset of nephrotic syndrome during interferon-alpha retreatment for chronic active hepatitis C.,"A 57-year-old woman was scheduled to receive recombinant interferon-alpha retreatment for chronic active hepatitis C. During the course of therapy, the patient showed rapid onset of oliguria, dizziness, edema, and a pre-shock state. She was subsequently admitted to hospital and was diagnosed as having nephrotic syndrome. After admission, albumin-dominant proteinuria persisted despite the discontinuation of interferon therapy. Light microscopy of a renal needle biopsy specimen showed interstitial lymphoid cell infiltration, but no marked changes of the glomeruli and no staining for immunoglobulin or complement. Electron microscopy showed diffuse effacement of the glomerular epithelial foot processes, leading to a diagnosis of minimal change nephrotic syndrome with interstitial nephritis. Proteinuria resolved after the initiation of oral prednisolone therapy (1 mg/kg per day). The number of patients with chronic hepatitis C requiring interferon retreatment is increasing rapidly. We herein report this rare case of acute onset of nephrotic syndrome during interferon-alpha retreatment.",2002,0

A 21-year-old man with Tourette's syndrome, pedophilia, Asperger's syndrome, and multiple sclerosis experienced seizures after receiving therapy with interferon beta-1a. Adjustments in his drug regimen led to the discovery of pseudoparkinsonism and other extrapyramidal symptoms. This case report illustrates how pharmacodynamic properties of drugs can complicate the treatment of neurologic disorders. Clinicians must be aware of the delicate balance between the signs and symptoms of disease states and the effects of drugs.",2002,11

Hypersensitivity to carboplatin is a rare but real complication of therapy and should be considered in patients presenting with hyperacute changes on ECG whilst receiving carboplatin therapy.,2002,11
256,1244265,Acute respiratory failure precipitated by a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.,A 60-year-old white man with chronic bronchitis was noted to develop acute respiratory failure and metabolic acidosis four days after being started on methazolamide (Neptazane) for an ophthalmologic problem. The patient was intubated with ventilator support and improved after his metabolic acidosis resolved. Caution is emphasized in the use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in patients with obstructive airway disease.,1976,1
257,12452753,Fluorouracil for allergic reactions to capecitabine.,"To report the safe use of fluorouracil in a patient with breast cancer who had allergic reactions to capecitabine.
A 42-year-old African American woman with metastatic breast cancer developed progressive disease. Capecitabine 1500 mg taken by mouth twice daily was prescribed as the salvage chemotherapy. She developed a generalized rash and itching, sore throat, and dizziness approximately 4 hours after the first dose of capecitabine. These reactions recurred immediately after the second dose. Capecitabine was discontinued and the allergic reactions resolved after the woman took diphenhydramine for 1 week. In view of limited therapeutic options for her progressive disease, a trial of fluorouracil 300 mg/m(2)/d continuous intravenous infusion over 5 days was initiated without any premedications. She did not experience any reactions. The dose of fluorouracil in the second cycle was increased to 400 mg/m(2)/d continuous infusion over 5 days.
Capecitabine is not intrinsically cytotoxic, but is converted to fluorouracil in tumor tissues via a 3-step enzymatic pathway. Capecitabine reaches peak blood concentrations in about 1.5 hours, with peak fluorouracil concentrations occurring at 2 hours. The elimination half-life of both drugs is 0.5-0.7 hours. The patient tolerated the rechallenge with fluorouracil without complications. Objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse event was probably drug induced. It was postulated that the allergic reaction was most likely caused by capecitabine or the intermediate metabolites based on the immediate reappearance of symptoms from the rechallenge, pharmacokinetic data, and well-tolerance of fluorouracil.
The use of fluorouracil treatment with careful monitoring can be considered in a patient with mild allergic reactions to capecitabine.",2002,12
258,12455453,Steroid diabetes in children with Crohn disease.,"Glucocorticoids may be useful as short-term palliative therapy for acute exacerbations of Crohn disease. When glucocorticoids are used for longer than brief periods, even in moderate dosages, they can produce a variety of adverse effects, including steroid diabetes. Two boys were treated with methylprednisolone due to acute exacerbations of Crohn disease. After five and six weeks of continuous oral administration of methylprednisolone, the boys developed steroid diabetes. Diabetic symptoms dominated the clinical presentation but there was no tendency towards diabetic ketoacidosis. Reduction of methylprednisolone dosage rather than insulin therapy resulted in better control of glycemia. Frequent blood glucose monitoring is recommended in children on prolonged therapy with glucocorticoids. Steroid diabetes experienced by the reported cases may be a marker for the onset of diabetes in their adulthood.",2002,0
259,12460237,Recurrent palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia following high-dose cytarabine treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE) is an uncommon cutaneous complication of cytotoxic chemotherapy which generally presents as a painful erythema involving the palms and soles. It has been suggested that PPE caused by cytarabine does not recur with subsequent cytarabine re-challenge. We report a patient with recurrent, increasingly severe episodes of PPE, ultimately complicated by a severe bullous eruption, following successive cycles of high-dose cytarabine for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Contrary to previous recommendations, our experience cautions against the further use of high-dose cytarabine in patients who develop PPE, and is a timely reminder of the potential toxicity of this agent, which is now increasingly being used as first-line treatment in the management of haematologic malignancies.",0,0
260,12477460,Ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising from an endometriotic cyst in a postmenopausal woman under tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer: a case report.,"Ovarian cancer arising from an endometriotic cyst in a postmenopausal woman under tamoxifen therapy is rare.
We herein report the case of a 67-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, taking tamoxifen citrate 20 mg/day for 4 years, who underwent an operation for left ovarian tumor. The postoperative histological diagnosis was endometrioid adenocarcinoma in an endometriotic cyst with a gradual transition of the degree of cellular atypia noted from typical endometriotic epithelium, to atypical endometriosis, and finally to adenocarcinoma.
Tamoxifen may cause malignant transformation of endometriosis through atypical endometriosis even in the postmenopausal state. Atypical endometriosis may act as a precancerous lesion in the process of tamoxifen-induced malignant transformation of endometriosis.",2002,11
261,12488741,Reversible MR imaging and MR spectroscopy abnormalities in association with metronidazole therapy.,"We present a report of MRI and proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) findings in an adolescent patient with Down syndrome and Crohn disease treated with metronidazole. MRI revealed signal abnormalities within the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, and brainstem. Proton MRS examination demonstrated a persistent lactate elevation during metronidazole treatment. Clinical, spectroscopic, and imaging abnormalities resolved with discontinuation of metronidazole.",0,0
262,12494253,Anaphylaxis to cisplatin following nine previous uncomplicated cycles.,"Anaphylaxis to cisplatin is an infrequent life-threatening complication which may occur even in patients who have received prior treatment with cisplatin. We report here a patient with carcinoma of the cervix with recurrent abdominal and thoracic disease who was previously treated with concurrent cisplatin and radiation for local control of pelvic disease. After nine previous uncomplicated cycles she developed severe anaphylaxis to cisplatin. The anaphylactic reaction was managed successfully with corticosteroids, nebulization with beta(2) agonists, and isotonic fluid support. With the extensive use of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, either alone or in combination with radiation therapy in the management of gynecological malignancies, this uncommon complication should be kept in mind for early detection and successful management.",2002,12
263,12503933,Fulminant liver failure associated with clarithromycin.,"To report a patient developing fulminant liver failure while being treated with clarithromycin for pneumonia.
A 58-year-old white woman developed fulminant liver failure while being treated with the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin for pneumonia. Comedication included N-acetylcysteine, atenolol, and isradipine. Other causes of liver failure, such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, toxins, and heart failure, were excluded by appropriate diagnostic means. All drugs were stopped, and the patient was transferred to another hospital for liver transplantation. She recovered spontaneously within several days, making transplantation unnecessary. A liver biopsy obtained 10 days after the initial presentation revealed centroacinar necrosis and beginning fibrous reorganization, compatible with recent centroacinar damage.
Since no other cause could be identified, liver injury was considered to be drug related. Fulminant liver failure has not previously been described with concomitant use of atenolol and N-acetylcysteine. Although isradipine has been associated with hepatocellular injury, there are no reports of fulminant liver failure with this agent, and our patient had been treated for >2 years without signs of toxicity. The most likely cause of liver failure in this patient was, therefore, clarithromycin, which undergoes hepatic metabolism and has been reported to cause fulminant hepatic failure. A second possibility is an interaction between clarithromycin and isradipine, potentially increasing the hepatic toxicity of isradipine.
Clarithromycin may be a cause of fulminant liver failure either alone or by inhibiting the metabolism of other drugs.",2003,1
264,12504711,A paradoxical ocular effect of brimonidine.,"We report an unusual paradoxical effect of brimonidine.
Observational case report.
A 70-year-old woman with bilateral normal tension glaucoma was treated with topical brimonidine and followed in an outpatient setting. The main outcome measured was intraocular pressure (IOP) in mm Hg.
Brimonidine was observed to cause IOP elevation, confirmed on rechallenge, scoring 8 (strong probability) on an adverse drug reaction probability score.
Under certain circumstances topical brimonidine can cause paradoxical raised IOP necessitating vigilance in follow-up of patients on topical brimonidine.",2003,1
265,12507063,Gabapentin withdrawal presenting as status epilepticus.,"A 34-year-old male with lumbar disc disease and surgery was placed on gabapentin daily for chronic back pain. He remained on a steady dose of 8000 mg/day for 9 months, almost doubled what is considered therapeutic. He ran out of medication, was unable to refill his prescription for 2 days and presented to the emergency department in status epilepticus. There was no previous history of seizure disorder and he was on no other medications. A medical evaluation for an alternative etiology of his seizures was negative. Although gabapentin withdrawal has been previously reported and usually consists of anxiety, diaphoresis, and palpitations, this is the first reported patient with generalized seizures and status epilepticus secondary to gabapentin withdrawal.",2002,0
266,12523465,Visual hallucinations associated with zonisamide.,"Zonisamide is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug used to treat various types of seizures. Although visual hallucinations have not been reported as an adverse effect of this agent, we describe three patients who experienced complex visual hallucinations and altered mental status after zonisamide treatment was begun or its dosage increased. All three had been diagnosed earlier with epilepsy, and their electroencephalogram (EEG) findings were abnormal. During monitoring, visual hallucinations did not correlate with EEG readings, nor did video recording capture any of the described events. None of the patients had experienced visual hallucinations before this event. The only recent change in their treatment was the introduction or increased dosage of zonisamide. With either discontinuation or decreased dosage of the drug the symptoms disappeared and did not recur. Further observations and reports will help clarify this adverse effect. Until then, clinicians need to be aware of this possible complication associated with zonisamide.",2003,1
267,12540009,Doxycycline-induced hypoglycemia in a nondiabetic young man.,"The medication history is an integral part in the evaluation of a patient with hypoglycemia. A variety of medications have been associated with hypoglycemia, but the list of these medications is expanding. We report the first case of doxycycline-induced hypoglycemia in a young nondiabetic man.",2002,11
268,12546343,Successful desensitization to high-dose methotrexate after systemic anaphylaxis.,"Methotrexate (MTX) is a folic acid antagonist used in high doses as adjuvant chemotherapy for osteosarcoma. It has many known toxicities and has been reported to cause anaphylaxis. We report the first successful desensitization protocol to high-dose MTX.
The patient is a 22-year-old male with the evaluation of osteosarcoma, T1Gr2NxM0. He received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and later underwent a right above the knee amputation without complication. He was then scheduled to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with high-dose MTX, 12 g/m2 body surface area, followed by leucovorin rescue and ifosfamide. He had an immediate hypersensitivity reaction during the initiation of the MTX infusion with diffuse urticaria, facial swelling, cough, and chest tightness. The infusion was terminated and his symptoms abated. He was later skin tested to confirm allergy to MTX. In order for him to receive the needed chemotherapy, we developed a desensitization protocol that was administered in the intensive care unit. Before the infusion he was pretreated with ranitidine, cetirizine, hydroxyzine, montelukast, and prednisone. He underwent the desensitization without incident on repeated infusions. Serum tryptase levels drawn during the infusions were low, signifying controlled mast cell degranulation.
This case describes the original development of a desensitization protocol to high-dose MTX. The successful development and implementation of this protocol will have impact on patients who have anaphylactic reactions to MTX but require this medication for specific diseases. For patients who suffer from osteogenic sarcoma and have anaphylactic reactions to MTX, this desensitization protocol will allow these patients to continue with needed therapeutic or palliative chemotherapy.",2003,1
269,12552054,Posterior leukoencephalopathy following intrathecal chemotherapy with MRA-documented vasospasm.,"Posterior leukoencephalopathy syndromes have been reported with hypertension, and immunosuppressive and chemotherapy agents. Cerebral vasospasm on MR angiography (MRA) has been noted in cases due to eclampsia. The authors report a case of Balint syndrome with irreversible posterior leukoencephalopathy on MRI following intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine. Hypertension was not present. Diffuse, reversible arterial irregularities consistent with vasospasm were present on MRA during the acute illness.",2003,1
270,12561997,Gelatinous transformation of bone marrow following chemotherapy for myeloma.,Gelatinous transformation of the marrow (GTBM) has been associated with various conditions. We present a unique case of GTBM in a patient with myeloma following treatment with Melphalan.,2001,1
271,12567347,Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis in a patient with postdural puncture headache.,"The occurrence of concomitant intracranial pathology in a patient with postdural puncture headache (PDPH) is rare. We present a patient who had a superior sagittal sinus thrombosis in addition to his PDPH. The signs and symptoms of intracranial pathology in patients with dural puncture headache, in addition to their postural headache, are discussed.
A 32-year-old man with lymphoblastic lymphoma received treatment with daunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. He developed postural headache and severe nausea and vomiting after a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed superior sagittal sinus (SSS) thrombosis and meningeal enhancement. An epidural blood patch was performed and enoxaparin was prescribed for 6 months. He has remained asymptomatic.
Patients with PDPH have classic postural headache. The occurrence of additional signs and symptoms should alert the clinician to the presence of intracranial pathology. Patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma who had treatment with L-asparaginase and steroid are predisposed to the development of cortical venous thrombosis and may have this syndrome in addition to a dural puncture headache.",0,0
272,12581772,Interstitial pneumonitis associated with sirolimus: a dilemma for lung transplantation.,"Rapamycin/sirolimus (SR), trade named Rapammune (Wyeth-Ayerst, Sydney, Australia), is a potent immunosuppressive drug associated with myelosuppression, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and infection. Rapamycin/sirolimus-induced pneumonitis has been described previously in renal transplant recipients, and this report describes a stable heart-lung transplant recipient who developed a pulmonary infiltrate that reversed after ceasing SR therapy. We believe that immunosuppression-induced pneumonitis in a lung allograft is a serious dilemma for lung transplant physicians",2003,2
273,12587815,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in an adolescent receiving olanzapine-lithium combination therapy.,"A 16-year-old boy developed fever, generalized rigidity, leukocytosis, and increased serum transaminase and creatine kinase levels while receiving treatment with olanzapine and lithium. When both drugs were discontinued, his fever and rigidity subsided and biochemical irregularities spontaneously returned to normal, without any complications. Classic neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) was diagnosed. Concomitant administration of lithium with olanzapine may place patients at risk for NMS. Clinicians need to be aware of this rare but potentially fatal side effect in patients of all ages, and especially in adolescents receiving both drugs.",2003,2
274,12590235,Hepatotoxicity associated with 6-thioguanine therapy for Crohn's disease.,"6-Thioguanine (6-TG) is a thiopurine analogue that is closely related to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and azathioprine (AZA). These agents have potent cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects and are useful in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease. Both 6-MP and AZA are widely used and are known to cause hepatotoxicity in a proportion of patients. 6-Thioguanine is being increasingly used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease but has not been reported to cause liver injury in this context. We describe a case of significant elevation of serum transaminases in a patient treated with 6-TG for a flare of Crohn's disease. We believe the temporal association of the abnormal liver enzymes in this patient, in the absence of other offending agents, argues strongly in favor of 6-TG as a cause of liver enzyme abnormalities. This case highlights the need to monitor liver enzymes in patients treated with 6-TG and identifies the need for additional research focused on the mechanism of thiopurine-induced hepatic injury.",2003,3
275,12598508,Early dialysis in a neonate with intrauterine lisinopril exposure.,"In general, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be discontinued in pregnancy, as they can induce an ACE fetopathy. For the treatment of the latter, early peritoneal dialysis is recommended for in utero exposure to captopril and enalapril, although the outcome is poor. Early peritoneal dialysis has not previously been reported for lisinopril induced multiorgan failure. A case is reported in which treatment was given on postnatal day 3. The patient recovered from oligoanuria to almost normal renal function, and heart, brain, and musculoskeletal injury was reversible. This is despite relatively poor clearance of the drug through peritoneal dialysis. Analysis of the pharmacokinetic data suggests that haemodialysis or haemofiltration would be more efficacious for removal of the drug, and these treatments should be performed if available.",2003,3
276,12605322,Transient panhypogammaglobulinaemia and B-lymphocyte deficiency in a patient with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus after immunosuppressive therapy.,"Panhypogammaglobulinaemia is a rare complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but its cause and mechanism are unclear. We observed transient panhypogammaglobulinaemia in a patient with neuropsychiatric SLE after treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide. After the patient developed recurrent infections, laboratory findings disclosed panhypogammaglobulinaemia with B-lymphocyte deficiency. The serum immunoglobulin level returned to the normal range after the prednisolone was tapered off. Because lupus patients are susceptible to infections associated with disease exacerbation or immunosuppressive treatment, recurrent infections might be expected during the disease course without need for further evaluation of the immunodeficiency. However, this reversible, probably drug-induced case of hypogammaglobulinaemia highlights the need for immunoglobulin measurements when immunodeficiency is suspected in lupus patients.",2003,2
277,1261772,Fulminant hepatitis and lymphocyte sensitization due to propylthiouracil.,"Fulminant hepatic failure developed in a 24-year-old black woman who had been treated with propylthiouracil and propranolol for hyperthyroidism. Clinical and biochemical recovery followed discontinuation of drug therapy. Liver biopsy disclosed submassive hepatic necrosis. During the acute phase of the disease, lymphocyte transformation  studies revealed sensitization of the patient's lymphocytes to propylthiouracil but not to propranolol. Sensitization remained demonstrable 2 months after cessation of the former drug. Lymphocytes obtained from a hyperthyroid patient treated with propylthiouracil without complications failed to show evidence of sensitization. These observations indicate that submassive hepatic necrosis may result from treatment with propylthiouracil and are consistent with the notion that sensitization mechanisms may be responsible for the hepatic injury induced by this drug.",1976,5
278,12621956,Atypical antipsychotic induced mild hypothermia.,"Atypical antipsychotic induced hypothermia is a rare adverse effect that may present with mild to severe symptoms. This is a case report of subtle, mild hypothermia in a 54-year old female patient receiving risperidone for schizophrenia. A mild decrease in the temperature (33.4-34.7 degrees C) along with delusions and feeling slightly chilly was part of the initial presentation. The diagnosis of hypothermia was delayed until it was apparent for several days but resolved with the discontinuation of risperidone and continuation of clozapine. Evaluation of hypothermia with psychiatric patients should include primary accidental hypothermia, central nervous system disorders, metabolic disorders, infections, and medications.",2003,2
279,12625995,Clozapine-induced akathisia in children with schizophrenia.,"Akathisia is a relatively rare side effect with the newer atypical antipsychotic agents, particularly clozapine, and is easily misdiagnosed in children. As children are often unable to describe their symptoms verbally, their akathisia can be misdiagnosed as worsening of their psychosis, prompting an unnecessary increase in their neuroleptic dose. Two cases of childhood-onset schizophrenia associated with clozapine-induced akathisia responsive to beta-blocker treatment are described. Akathisia should be considered in all cases of apparent nonresponse to atypical antipsychotics.",2002,0
280,12630660,Central pontine myelinolysis manifested by temporary blindness: a possible complication of lithium toxicity.,"Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is removal of myelin material from neural elements in a way that is not clearly known as yet. In this case of CPM, blindness was encountered and was thought to be ""hysterical."" The blindness went away after four months. After reviewing the literature we suggest the CPM was a complication of lithium toxicity which affected the lateral geniculate nucleus which produced blindness.",2002,12
281,12635752,Successful treatment with carbimazole of a hyperthyroid pregnancy with hepatic impairment after propylthiouracil administration: a case report.,"We report the case of a 27-year-old woman with hyperthyroidism during pregnancy. Antithyroid treatment with propylthiouracil (PTU) resulted in elevated hepatic enzymes and after the 12th week of pregnancy treatment was changed to carbimazole (CBZ). The remaining pregnancy, delivery and follow-up period were uneventful for the mother and her offspring. Antithyroid treatment during pregnancy should allow the use not only of PTU but also of CBZ and methimazole.",2002,0
282,12639299,Minimal change disease in a patient receiving IFN-alpha therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection.,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with several extrahepatic syndromes. The principal types of renal disorders associated with chronic HCV infection are cryoglobulinemia or noncryoglobulinemic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) may precipitate or exacerbate the occurrence of MPGN. Our patient was a 32-year-old man who tested positive for HCV in July 1997. The patient was treated with IFN-alpha in another medical center for 6 months because his liver biopsy showed chronic active hepatitis. In December 1998, he applied to our clinic for a follow-up examination. The level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 44 U/L, and that of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 69 U/L. HCV RNA was positive in serum, and chronic HCV infection was detected by liver biopsy. IFN-alpha therapy (5 million U/day) was administered for 6 months longer. In May 1999, the patient came to our polyclinic with edema of the feet and legs. We detected proteinuria, serum cholesterol of 269 mg/dl, AST of 50 U/L, ALT of 41 U/L, serum total protein of 3.4 g/dl, serum albumin of 1.2 g/dl, positive cryoglobulin, and urine protein of 9.84 g/day. Cryoglobulinemic MPGN was suspected and kidney biopsy was performed, resulting in a diagnosis of minimal change disease (MCD).",2003,1
283,12656748,Emergence of Philadelphia positive chronic myeloid leukaemia during treatment with hydroxyurea for Philadelphia negative essential thrombocythaemia.,"A 58-yr-old male patient with essential thrombocythaemia (ET) developed chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) after continuous uneventful treatment with hydroxyurea for 18 yr. G-banding analyses of bone marrow cells had repeatedly demonstrated normal male karyotype before this event, but t(9;22)(q34;q11) was demonstrated after the event. An unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed. Blood and bone marrow morphology, and the karyotype were normalised and the patient is in good health 1 yr post-transplant. There are no previous reports in the literature about the emergence of CML during treatment with hydroxyurea.",2003,4
284,12659609,Toxicity related to chloroquine treatment of resistant vivax malaria.,"To report a case of severe chloroquine toxicity in the presence of high-grade chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax.
A febrile 36-year-old seaman from Mumbai (Bombay) was prescribed >5 times the usual dose of chloroquine for malaria diagnosed empirically onboard ship. His fever resolved, but he developed symptoms consistent with those of chloroquine toxicity. Fever recurred 30 days after his initial presentation, and blood smear-positive vivax malaria was diagnosed. A serum chloroquine concentration at this time (91 micro g/L) was above that considered effective for chloroquine-sensitive P. vivax (>15 micro g/L). The patient responded to atovaquone plus proguanil followed by primaquine.
The patient was given chloroquine by his captain in a dosage regimen appropriate for quinine (2 tablets 3 times daily for 7 d). Pharmacokinetic modeling suggested that the patient's initial over-treatment was as reported and that the predicted maximum serum concentration of chloroquine (902 micro g/L) was within the range seen in fatal chloroquine overdose.
Chloroquine-resistant vivax malaria is increasingly widespread, and transmission can occur within large tropical population centers. For drugs with a narrow therapeutic index such as chloroquine, recommended dosing regimens should be respected, and adequate information sources must be available where such drugs are dispensed by untrained personnel.",2003,4
285,12661801,Treatment of carbimazole-induced agranulocytosis and sepsis with granulocyte colony stimulating factor.,"We present the management of agranulocytosis and neutropenic sepsis secondary to carbimazole with recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). A 72-year-old woman with a history of thyrotoxicosis presented with sore throat and fever two weeks after starting carbimazole. Investigations confirmed a leucopenia and neutropenia. G-CSF was used as an adjunctive therapy with discontinuation of carbimazole, barrier nursing and a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen to treat her neutropenic sepsis. Total white cell count and neutrophil count returned to normal and she made an uneventful recovery. She was subsequently rendered euthyroid with radioiodine treatment.",2003,3
286,12665232,Comeoscleral perforation after pterygium excision and intraoperative mitomycin C.,"A 28-year-old man underwent pterygium excision with a single intraoperative application of mitomycin C (0.02%) for 3 minutes. One week after the surgery, the patient developed a corneoscleral perforation with iris prolapse. To the best of our knowledge, corneoscleral melting in the first postoperative week after a single intraoperative application of mitomycin C has not been reported. Moreover, the perforation occurred despite using a minimum concentration of the drug, risk factors were absent, and the surgery was performed by an experienced surgeon. Although a single case, this report questions the safety of using an intraoperative application of mitomycin C for preventing a recurrence of pterygium.",0,0
287,1267457,Stevens-Johnson syndrome from ophthalmic sulfonamide.,"A 71-year-old man, who had a history of a previous bullous drug reaction to a sulfonamide, began receiving an ophthalmic preparation that contained sulfacetamide sodium. The patient received only the ophthalmic sulfonamide, and it was used for one day, but he developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome. This is believed to be the first reported case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome caused by an ophthalmic sulfonamide. The sulfonamides are the best verified drug-trigger for erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.",1976,4
288,12680486,Treatment of lithium-induced diabetes insipidus with amiloride.,"A 63-year-old African-American woman was admitted to the hospital with urosepsis and altered mental status. She had a history of schizophrenia and was treated with olanzapine 5 mg/day and lithium carbonate 300 mg 3 times/day. During her hospital stay, her sodium level and serum osmolality increased and her urine osmolality decreased, whereas her lithium levels remained within normal limits. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with diabetes insipidus secondary to lithium therapy and was treated successfully with amiloride. Clinicians have been aware of lithium toxicity for many years and traditionally have administered thiazide diuretics for lithium-induced polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Recently, amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic, has been reported as a successful treatment for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.",2003,4
289,12692521,Systemic capillary leak syndrome after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).,"Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) commonly occurs in the intensive care setting. CLS is seen in conditions such as septic shock or may result from conditions such as multitrauma and pancreatitis, which result in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). We present two cases in which both patients suffered with CLS, which we believe was caused following administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, to our knowledge not described in the intensive care patient previously. We discuss how these patients management differs from other intensive care unit patients with CLS and how it is important to diagnose this condition early in haematological oncology cases.",2003,0
290,12699871,Tacrolimus (FK506)-induced mutism after liver transplant.,"Tacrolimus (FK506), an immunosuppressant, has been associated with mutism in adults after liver transplant. Speech arrest, agitation, tremor, ataxia, and downward gaze deviation in a 5-year-old female 13 days after orthotopic liver transplant are reported. FK506, which began to be administered 12 days earlier, rose to a level of 44 ng/mL (normal range, 10-20 ng/mL) 1 day before neurologic abnormalities began. FK506 dose level was maintained and then reduced. Three days later the patient could say a few single words and extra-ocular movement returned to normal. Four months later, she continued to exhibit decreased fluency and dysarthria with ataxia. One year later, decreased fluency and mild ataxia persists. Rapid identification of speech loss linked to FK506 may be important because reduction or cessation of the drug may be associated with reverse of speech loss.",2003,2
291,12702914,"Does the use of insulin in a patient with liver dysfunction increase water retention in the body, i.e. cause insulin oedema?","A 68-year-old female with mild diabetes mellitus was admitted because of acute liver dysfunction due to autoimmune hepatitis. While 40 mg/day of prednisolone improved hepatic dysfunction dramatically, her diabetic milieu deteriorated seriously. The induced hyperglycaemia could not be controlled sufficiently, despite a high dose of insulin (> 110 units/day), suggesting the existence of insulin insensitivity and hyperinsulinaemia. Soon after introduction of insulin therapy, she developed severe anasarca, including marked peripheral oedema, ascites and pleural effusion. Anasarca eventually subsided within 4 weeks with the use of a diuretic agent. We conjectured that the side effects of insulin, such as anti-natriuresis and increased vascular permeability, might be pronounced in the presence of the hepatic dysfunction that accompanies insulin insensitivity, hyperinsulinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia.",2003,5
292,12707728,Intrathecal methotrexate-induced acute cerebellar syndrome.,"Intrathecal application of chemotherapeutics has been the mainstay of central nervous system prophylaxis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment.

293,12729371,Angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia following doxycycline administration.,"Angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia (AILD) is a primary lymphoproliferative T-cell disorder, currently classified as a peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. AILD is characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, immunological abnormalities, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and anemia. We report a case of AILD in an 80-year-old male who presented with a generalized pruritic maculopapular eruption and fever following doxycycline administration. The maculopapular rash progressed to formation of confluent nodules, plaques and finally erythroderma with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Blood analysis revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Lymph node biopsy showed almost complete effacement of the nodal architecture with diffuse proliferation of small vessels forming an arborizing network, surrounded by atypical lymphocytes, usually CD3+ CD4+ and occasionally CD3+ CD8+. There were also larger cells (immunoblastic shape) that displayed CD20 positively, some scattered plasma cells, and eosinophils. Histology of a cutaneous lesion showed spongiosis and infiltration of the epidermis by atypical lymphocytes with large hyperchromatic nuclei, perivascular dermal lymphocytic infiltrate (CD3+) mixed with plasma cells and occasional large immunoblasts (CD20+). During hospitalization the patient developed hemolytic anemia (Coombs positive) and lung metastases. The prognosis of AILD is generally poor, with a median survival of less than 20 months. Our patient died two and a half months after the diagnosis was made due to sepsis caused by Staphylococcus aureus isolated in hemoculture.",0,0

295,1275625,Hypocalcemia after therapeutic use of magnesium sulfate.,"It is now recognized that magnesium plays an important role in calcium homeostasis. Although the effects of hypomagnesemia have been frequently reported, little has been written to suggest a clinically important role for hypermagnesemia. A case is reported in which severe hypocalcemia, with a low plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration, resulted from the therapeutic use of magnesium sulfate for toxemia of pregnancy. Following recovery, the parathyroid glands were shown to respond normally to a phosphate load. It is suggested that the hypermagnesemia directly suppressed PTH secretion, resulting in symptomatic hypocalcemia.",1976,6
296,12757344,Carbamazepine-related hyponatremia following cardiopulmonary bypass.,"A 67-year-old man on long-term carbamazepine therapy underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting. Following an initially uncomplicated recovery, he developed symptomatic hyponatremia. The symptoms and biochemical abnormality improved after gradual discontinuation of carbamazepine. We discuss the association between carbamazepine and hyponatremia and the causes of hyponatremia after cardiopulmonary bypass. Surgeons should consider stopping carbamazepine before operations with cardiopulmonary bypass.",0,0
297,12763355,Sensorimotor polyneuropathy with 5-aminosalicylic acid: a case report.,"A 69-year-old man with ulcerative colitis (UC) developed sensorimotor polyneuropathy. First, he received salazosulphapyridine (SASP) as treatment for the UC. The symptoms of UC disappeared immediately, but he developed skin eruptions and dysesthesia in his lower limbs. When SASP was changed to 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), his skin eruptions were resolved, however, he developed weakness and atrophy in his right arm as well as progressive worsening of the dysesthesia in his legs and gait disturbance. Deep tendon reflexes (DTR) were absent in all extremities. After 5-ASA was discontinued, the polyneuropathy symptoms recovered gradually. This clinical course suggests that the sensorimotor polyneuropathy may have been caused by 5-ASA.",2003,5
298,12773807,Disseminated cellulitic cryptococcosis in the setting of prednisone monotherapy for pemphigus vulgaris.,"Cryptococcal infections are seen mainly in immunocompromised hosts. The cutaneous manifestations of infection can include papules, plaques, nodules, vesicles, ulcers, ecchymosis, and, rarely, cellulitis. Cryptococcal meningitis is a life-threatening complication of this disease. Pemphigus vulgaris is a rare auto-immune blistering disease that can also be life-threatening. Treatment of pemphigus commonly entails both corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents. We present a case of disseminated cryptococcal infection in a patient with pemphigus vulgaris treated with high dose corticosteroids as monotherapy. This case provides an opportunity to discuss the difficulty of managing two potentially mortal conditions in which the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris may exacerbate the disseminated cryptococcal infection.",2003,5
299,12786839,Slow acetylator genotypes as a possible risk factor for infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome induced by salazosulfapyridine.,"We report two patients with infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome induced by salazosulfapyridine (SASP). In both cases, high fever, skin rash, liver dysfunction and atypical lymphocytosis developed 3 weeks after initiating treatment with SASP. SASP is known to be mainly metabolized by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), and acetylation phenotypes (rapid, intermediate and slow acetylator) correlate with NAT2* genotypes. In our two patients, we investigated NAT2* genotypes by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. We identified NAT2*6/*7 in one patient, and NAT2*6/*5 in the other, suggesting that both were slow acetylator phenotypes. In 20 healthy volunteers we found no slow acetylator genotypes. Genotyping prior to medication may be useful in evaluating patients with a high risk of severe systemic reaction to SASP.",2003,5
300,12792223,A lupus-like syndrome associated with infliximab therapy.,"Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), is efficacious in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. We report in detail an unusual adverse reaction to infliximab therapy, a drug-induced lupus-like clinical syndrome. A 45-year-old woman with steroid-dependent Crohn's colitis, successfully managed with maintenance infliximab infusions and methotrexate, developed a lupus-like syndrome eight months after her initial infusion. This was characterized by inflammatory arthritis and an urticarial and papulosquamous rash and was accompanied by high titers of antinuclear, double-stranded DNA, glomerular-binding, and histone antibodies and by reduced levels of the C4 component of complement. After discontinuance of infliximab infusions and treatment of symptoms with intermittent courses of prednisone, the patient's arthritis progressively improved, with accompanying decrements in autoantibody titers. One year later, she has minimal joint discomfort and no rash or gastrointestinal symptoms despite also discontinuing prednisone and methotrexate. Infliximab therapy may cause a lupus-like syndrome that is reversible upon discontinuing this agent. These findings support recent evidence identifying TNF-alpha as an inhibitor of autoantibody formation.",2003,5
301,12796597,Interferon-alpha-induced focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia: a case report and review of the literature.,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hepatitis C, and interferon alpha (IFNalpha) have all been associated with renal dysfunction. In this paper we present a patient with the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome and a known history of hepatitis C who received IFNalpha therapy for newly diagnosed CML. The renal biopsy showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which has only been previously reported in two cases of CML treated with IFNalpha. There have also been two cases of patients with hepatitis C associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Despite the underlying hepatitis C, this case represents renal abnormalities consistent with IFNalpha therapy for CML.",2003,6
302,12802933,Severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia following rituximab therapy in a patient with a lymphoproliferative disorder.,"Rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 IgG1 monoclonal antibody) is effective in the treatment of relapsed/refractory low-grade lymphomas of B-cell origin as well as in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Several reports also demonstrated the efficacy of rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune cytopenia, especially for cold agglutinin disease. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of rituximab-related autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The pathophysiological mechanisms remain unknown, although the drug could act through massive cytokines liberation after destruction of CD20 positive cells by rituximab.",2003,5
303,12806509,Early-onset acute transverse myelitis following hepatitis B vaccination and respiratory infection: case report.,"Acute transverse myelitis is an acute inflammatory process of the spinal cord and it is a rare clinical syndrome in childhood. In this paper, we report a case of 3 years-old boy who developed acute onset tetraparesia following a viral respiratory infecction and hepatitis B vaccination. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord disclosed signal-intensity abnormalities from C4 to C3. A diagnosis of acute transverse myelitis was made and the patient was treated with IV methylprednisolone and IV immunoglobulin. The child had a fair outcome despite of the very acute course of the disease and the presence of a cervical sensory level which usually harbor a poor prognosis.",2003,6
304,12811715,Diphenhydramine-induced wide complex dysrhythmia responds to treatment with sodium bicarbonate.,"Diphenhydramine, a common ingredient in over-the-counter medications, is often taken in overdose. Toxicity is usually limited to anticholinergic symptoms. However, because diphenhydramine also exhibits type IA sodium channel blockade, cardiac toxicity is also possible. Although it would be expected that, like other type IA toxicities, diphenhydramine-induced cardiotoxicity could be responsive to hypertonic sodium bicarbonate, this finding is largely unappreciated. We describe 3 cases of diphenhydramine-induced cardiac toxicity that were responsive to bicarbonate.",2003,5
305,12823045,Giant blastoconidia of Candida albicans. A case report and review of the literature.,"We describe a patient with extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma who developed systemic candidiasis after treatment with a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen. Histologically, the fungal organisms demonstrated markedly enlarged blastoconidia with a variety of morphologic forms, mimicking other mycotic organisms, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The in vivo occurrence of such giant forms is rare, and when observed histologically may result in an erroneous diagnosis or a diagnosis of multiple mycotic organisms.",2003,7
306,12836099,Stevens-Johnson syndrome in a boy with nephrotic syndrome during prednisolone therapy.,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a mucocutaneous disease that can be lethal. It can occur in association with altered immunological conditions and the administration of various drugs, including corticosteroids. We report a case of SJS in a 14-year-old male with nephrotic syndrome, who was treated with oral prednisolone for 6 weeks. He presented symptoms of fever, skin lesions consisting of multiple vesiculopapular rashes, pruritic maculae and bullae, and mucosal involvement of the eyes, lips, oral cavity, and anorectal junction. His condition improved without complications following the discontinuation of oral prednisolone and replacement with intravenous methylprednisolone. Following the improvement of the symptoms of SJS, he received alternate-day oral prednisolone without any cutaneous eruption.",2003,9
307,12847760,Reversal reaction to Hansen's disease.,"A 25-year-old man with a history of mid-borderline (BB) Hansen's disease developing a reversal reaction after starting dapsone and rifampin therapy is presented. His clinical features included erythematous, edematous plaques and peripheral neuropathy. Reversal reactions are caused immunologically by enhanced cell-mediated (Th-1) immunity to Mycobacterium leprae, resulting in inflammation of infected tissues, such as skin and nerves. Acute neuritis can lead to permanent nerve damage and necessitate prompt treatment with prednisone and/or clofazamine.",2002,7
308,12852380,Thalidomide as elective treatment in persistent erythema multiforme; report of two cases.,"Recurrent erythema multiforme is a rare disorder, clinically characterized by symmetrically distributed, erythematous, and bullous skin and mucous lesions, mainly precipitated by a preceding herpes simplex infection. In rare cases, EM presents continuous or persistent relapses, and has been related to an Epstein-Barr virus infection. We report 2 cases of severe, persistent erythema multiforme, treated with thalidomide, with complete disease suppression in both cases. Thalidomide induces immunomodulator, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic effects, and may be considered as the elective treatment of this rare variety of erythema multiforme. However, in order to avoid neuropathic side effects, patients under thalidomide therapy should be monitored every 6 months with nerve conduction studies while taking the drug.",2003,1
309,12854039,Multiple sclerosis-like disease secondary to alpha interferon.,"To describe bilateral optic neuritis that occurred as an adverse effect of recombinant and natural interferon alpha administration.
Report of two cases. Case 1, a 62-year-old woman, developed bilateral optic neuritis with decreased sensation of vibration and increased deep tendon reflex in the lower extremities after a seven-month use of recombinant interferon alpha-2a for chronic active hepatitis C. Case 2, a 29-year-old woman, developed bilateral optic neuritis combined with numbness of the lower extremities as well as bowel and bladder dysfunction after a 22-month use of recombinant interferon alpha-2b for chronic myelogenous leukemia. After a two-month interruption of interferon administration, natural interferon alpha was given but followed by another episode of the same neurological manifestations.
In both cases, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple small high-intensity areas in the cerebral white matter and spinal cord, while cerebrospinal fluid examination disclosed mononuclear cell increase and protein elevation including myelin basic protein, all of which simulated the features of multiple sclerosis. The two patients underwent several courses of pulse corticosteroid therapy, each course consisting of three days of methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily, resulting in visual recovery to some extent.
Optic neuritis in combination with other neurological signs, simulating multiple sclerosis, should be included in the list of adverse effects of recombinant and natural interferon alpha administration.",2002,12

312,12869178,Massive pulmonary embolism due to late-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia following coronary artery bypass graft surgery: successful treatment with lepirudin.,"Most cardiac surgical patients have had previous exposure to heparin for diagnostic or therapeutic interventions and hence have an increased susceptibility to developing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) postoperatively. HIT is an immune-mediated adverse drug reaction that may be associated with limb or life-threatening thrombosis. Heparin cessation is a vital first step in treatment; however, alternative anticoagulant therapy is essential. Recombinant hirudin (lepirudin), a thrombin-specific inhibitor, provides safe and effective anticoagulation in such patients. We describe a case of delayed onset HIT with resulting massive pulmonary embolism postcardiac surgery that was successfully managed with lepirudin.",0,0
313,12875956,Acute psychosis associated with levetiracetam.,"A twelve year-old-girl with idiopathic partial epilepsy with secondary generalization, developed acute psychosis 10 days after the administration of levetiracetam. The patient was already on sodium valproate, and levetiracetam was given as add on therapy. A final dosage of 60 mg/kg was used. Complete seizure control was achieved but the patient developed hallucinations, agitation and self-harming behaviour, as well as poor social contact. The psychotic behavior resolved completely soon after the discontinuation of levetiracetam.",2003,6
314,12880504,Risperidone-induced obsessive-compulsive symptoms in two children.,"To present two cases of rapid-onset obsessive-compulsive symptoms in children treated with risperidone.
""A"" was an 8-year-old boy with attention deficit and chronic tic disorder who developed obsessive-compulsive symptoms within 2 weeks of starting risperidone. When the dose of 0.5 mg tid was discontinued, the obsessive-compulsive symptoms resolved with no return over 8 months of follow-up. ""B"" was an 11-year-old girl with mild mental retardation and aggression who was treated with risperidone 1 mg per day. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms suddenly emerged 10 days after starting risperidone and resolved within 3 days of discontinuation. In both cases, streptococcal pharyngitis was ruled out.
Although the mechanism is not clear, these cases add to several other reports concerning the sudden emergence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and anxiety symptoms in children treated with atypical antipsychotics. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of these adverse effects in children treated with these drugs.",2003,0
315,1288290,"Proliferation of abnormal bone marrow histiocytes, an undesired effect of granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor therapy in a patient with Hurler's syndrome undergoing bone marrow transplantation.","Granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has shown promise as a means of alleviating leukopenia associated with a wide variety of disorders. It is currently undergoing evaluation as an adjunct to bone marrow transplantation but its use in patients with metabolic disorders, such as Hurler's syndrome (HS), has not been explored. We followed bone marrow morphology in a 2-year-old male with HS who received up to 8 micrograms/kg GM-CSF per day because of failure of allogeneic bone marrow engraftment. Both premortem and postmortem bone marrow sampling revealed almost complete replacement of the marrow space by sheets of histiocytes demonstrating metachromatic cytoplasmic granules. Such cells were present in far greater numbers than are usually seen in untreated patients with HS or patients with HS undergoing successful bone marrow transplantation without GM-CSF. Moreover, the in vitro culture of bone marrow from a second HS patient showed a GM-CSF dose-related increase in colony formation up to a dose of 250 units/ml. Microscopic examination of these colonies showed a high percentage of histiocytes identical to those seen in the patient's bone marrow. These observations suggest that caution should be exercised when considering administration of CSFs to patients with HS and similar metabolic storage diseases.",1992,12
316,12885108,Possible heart failure exacerbation associated with rosiglitazone: case report and literature review.,"Increasing evidence suggests that neurohumoral manifestations of heart failure may lead to insulin resistance, predisposing patients with heart failure to the development of glucose intolerance or worsening of existing diabetes. Theoretically, insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones (TZDs) should be beneficial in this patient population. A 74-year-old man with well-compensated systolic dysfunction and longstanding type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with glyburide began therapy with rosiglitazone 4 mg/day, which was increased to 8 mg/day after 1 month. Two weeks later he was seen with a 5-kg weight gain, shortness of breath, bibasilar rales, +S3 gallop, and increased jugular venous distention. Twelve days later symptoms worsened, with pulmonary edema on chest radiograph, continued weight gain, and +4 pitting edema resistant to oral diuretics. The patient was admitted to the hospital for exacerbation of heart failure. Five days after discharge he was readmitted for similar symptoms, including an 11.8-kg weight gain. He reported adherence to drug therapy and diet. Rosiglitazone was immediately discontinued and 11 days later the man's weight stabilized to 79 kg and remained between 79 and 80 kg 2 and 3 months after discharge. This case demonstrates that TZDs may precipitate weight gain and pulmonary and peripheral edema in patients with stable heart failure. Earlier reports documented similar symptoms in patients without a history of heart failure. Although current recommendations state that TZDs should not be administered to patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV disease, practitioners should be aware that these adverse effects also may occur in patients with milder forms heart failure as well as those without heart failure.",2003,7
317,12889716,Enoxaparin-induced generalized exanthem.,"Adverse cutaneous reactions to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are uncommon in the literature. They are usually localized reactions such as ecchymoses, erythematous plaques, and nodules. Only one case of a generalized maculopapular rash with enoxaparin has been reported in Europe. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the English literature of a generalized exanthem due to subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin.",2003,7
318,12908837,Brief report: clonazepam behavioral side effects with an individual with mental retardation.,"Behavioral side effects associated with clonazepam may include agitation, aggression, hyperactivity, irritability, property destruction, and temper tantrums. These side effects may be inadvertently confused with other behavioral or psychiatric conditions, especially if exacerbation of existing challenging behavior occurs. This report describes an individual with mental retardation who experienced behavioral exacerbation associated with clonazepam prescribed at 2 mg/day (0.02 mg/kg/day) to treat aggression, self-injurious behavior, property destruction, and screaming, which was measured with a 15-minute partial interval recording measurement method. When clonazepam was reduced and discontinued, these behaviors significantly decreased from 3.1% of intervals (95% confidence band = 1.6% to 4.6%) to 0.1% of intervals (95% confidence band = 0% to 0.1%). Indicators suggesting review by appropriate medical personnel for possible clonazepam behavioral side effects are provided.",2003,6
319,12915840,Cefuroxime-induced immune hemolysis.,Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (IHA) is rare but is being reported with increasing frequency.

We report the first case of IHA associated with cefuroxime administration.,2003,7
320,12921505,Argatroban for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in hepato-renal failure and CVVHD.,"To report a case of significant hepatic and renal failure with the use of argatroban in a patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) requiring continuous veno-veno hemodialysis (CVVHD).
A 37-year-old Hispanic man with diabetes mellitus, ethanol abuse, and recent crank use developed a venous thrombosis and possible pulmonary embolism, followed by acute liver and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. After several days of heparin therapy, the dialyzer circuit thrombosed and the platelet count decreased to 82 x 10(3)/mm(3). Antibodies for HIT by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were positive. Heparin was discontinued, and an argatroban infusion was initiated. After 39 hours on argatroban, the infusion was stopped when minor bleeding was observed with a concurrent activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 100 seconds. The dialyzer circuit did not clot during the argatroban infusion and did not apparently influence dose-related aPTT measurements. Several days were required for the aPTT to decrease after stopping the argatroban infusion. Fresh frozen plasma had no apparent effect on aPTT values.
Several different agents are currently available to provide effective anticoagulation in patients who have immune- mediated HIT. Argatroban is hepatically cleared and may be the preferred direct thrombin inhibitor in the presence of significant renal impairment, but conversely has prolonged effects in hepatic failure. Limited data are available regarding use of direct thrombin inhibitors in patients who have severe hepatic impairment with concurrent renal failure requiring CVVHD. Scant data are available regarding the effect of hemodialysis on the elimination of argatroban.
The optimal anticoagulant for use in a patient with HIT and concurrent hepatic and renal failure is unclear. No direct thrombin inhibitor has a proven advantage; therefore, selection may depend on clinical factors. Dosing in these patients requires very careful management.",2003,9
321,12923827,Schneiderian first-rank symptoms associated with fluvoxamine treatment: a case report.,"This communication describes a patient who developed Schneiderian first-rank symptoms in the course of treatment with fluvoxamine. The patient, a 28-year-old man suffering from panic disorder, developed several first-rank symptoms during fluvoxamine administration. These symptoms abated 1 week after fluvoxamine treatment was discontinued and haloperidol was started. Although haloperidol was discontinued, no further hallucinations or delusions occurred. This finding suggests that fluvoxamine can precipitate Schneiderian first-rank symptoms in some susceptible patients.",2003,8
322,12927328,Comorbidity of parkinsonism and schizophrenia in a patient treated with clozapine.,Clozapine is the least likely anti-psychotic to induce extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). We present a surprising case of a woman schizophrenic patient treated with clozapine suffering from EPS. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed a low density of presynaptic dopamine transporters in our patient's brain. A comorbid diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in schizophrenia was confirmed in this way. This helped us to find a proper therapeutic strategy for our patient.,2003,8
323,12932249,Hyperpigmentation during interferon-alpha therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection.,"Many types of skin disorders concomitantly occur with hepatitis C virus infection. These skin lesions may be induced or worsened during antiviral therapy with interferon-alpha (IFN). To our knowledge, hyperpigmentation of the skin--and especially of the tongue--has not been reported so far. We describe two dark-skinned patients who developed hyperpigmented skin and tongue lesions during combination therapy with IFN and ribavirin. Immunohistochemical analysis of tongue biopsies confirmed the suspicion of melanin deposits in these areas of hyperpigmentation. We hypothesize that during interferon therapy, melanocytes may produce more melanin pigment in the presence of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and sufficient amounts of tyrosine, leading to melanin deposits and clinical hyperpigmentation.",2003,8
324,12944250,Thrombocytosis under ciprofloxacin and tazobactam/piperacillin.,"Whether the simultaneous administration of ciprofloxacin or tazobactam/piperacillin increases the risk of thrombocytosis is unknown. Broncho-pulmonary infection in a 50-year-old male with acute, hypertensive, intracerebral bleeding, necessitated therapy with cefpirome (2 g/day, 6 days), ciprofloxacin (800 mg/d, 11 days) and tazobactam/piperacillin (9 g/day, 11 days). Starting with the 8th hospital day, the thrombocyte count steadily increased from 410000/microl to a maximum of 1132000/microl on hospital day 16. Afterwards the thrombocyte count continuously decreased to normal values. Primary thrombocytosis and secondary causes were excluded. Since the thrombocyte count started to increase immediately after initiation and dropped immediately after discontinuation of ciprofloxacin and tazobactam/piperacillin and all other drugs were discontinued already before or were started after the nadir of the thrombocyte count, these two antibiotics were regarded causative. It is concluded that simultaneous administration of ciprofloxacin and tazobactam/piperacillin may cause marked thrombocytosis. Discontinuation of these two antibiotics results in an immediate decline of the thrombocyte count to normal values within three weeks.",2003,8
325,129501,Two anaphylactic deaths after chemonucleolysis.,"Chemonucleolysis is a procedure for treatment of low back pain due to discogenic disease in which the drug chymopapain is injected into lumbar disks to produce chemical dissolution of the nucleus pulposus. More than 15,000 cases have been treated by chemonucleolysis world-wide. Anaphylaxis after the injection of chymopapain occurs in about 1% of such cases. The two cases described in this paper are the only known deaths due to anaphylaxis. Both patients suddenly became hypotensive after injection of chymopapain into a disk. One patient died shortly after this, whereas the second patient died of the complications of prolonged shock.",1976,1

329,1310879,Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia: successful therapy with the heparinoid Org 10172 in a patient showing cross-reaction to LMW heparins.,"A patient suffering from heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (HAT), recurrent arteriothromboses, and acute renal failure after treatment with standard heparin is described. He failed to improve when therapy was continued with low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin (Fragmin, Kabi Pfrimmer, Erlangen, FRG). By means of the in vitro heparin-induced platelet activation (HIPA) assay it was shown that standard heparin and the LMW heparins Fragmin and Fraxiparin (Sanofi Labaz, Munich, FRG), as well as the enoxaparine Clexane (Nattermann, Cologne, FRG), all induced platelet activation with the patient's serum. In contrast, the LMW heparinoid Org 10172 (Organon, Oss, The Netherlands) did not cause platelet activation. When the patient was subsequently treated by parenteral administration of Org 10172 as anticoagulant over a period of several weeks the number of platelets rapidly increased and the patient almost completely recovered. This case shows that strong in vivo and in vitro cross-reactivity between standard heparin and LMW heparins may occur, but can be avoided by the use of a novel heparinoid, Org 10172. The HIPA assay provides a simple and sensitive laboratory method for the choice of an innocuous heparin or heparinoid for continued parenteral anticoagulation.",1992,1

332,1356045,Acute myopathy with selective degeneration of myosin filaments following status asthmaticus treated with methylprednisolone and vecuronium.,"We report two cases of severe, acute myopathy with selective degeneration of myosin filaments in asthmatics who developed respiratory failure with hypercapnia and acidosis requiring endotracheal intubation, administration of vecuronium and prolonged ventilatory support. Hypoxia was documented in one case and probably present in the other. Both patients received prolonged treatment with high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone. Flaccid quadriparesis was noted after discontinuation of vecuronium. Muscle biopsy showed nonspecific myopathic changes on light microscopy. Electron microscopy revealed selective loss of myosin filaments in many fibers. Recovery occurred within 2 months with supportive treatment. This entity is probably related to a combination of high doses of corticosteroids, vecuronium administration and metabolic abnormalities associated with respiratory failure.",1992,0

The clinical picture and radiological abnormalities disappeared spontaneously on discontinuation of the drug. Histopathological studies from specimens taken by transbronchial biopsy showed bronchiolitis obliterans with fibrosing alveolitis. Sulfasalazine-induced lung disorder is an extremely rare entity which must be considered in all ulcerative colitis patients while on sulfasalazine therapy, despite the absence of pulmonary symptomatology.",1992,11

Liver biopsy revealed a reduction in activity of carbamyl phosphate synthetase-I, an enzyme obligated for transformation of ammonia to urea in the urea cycle. After recovery CT scan follow-up showed marked cerebral atrophy which did not exist prior to the state of coma. Risk factors are discussed.",1992,9
340,1420650,Asterixis induced by carbamazepine therapy.,"There are very few reports about asterixis as a side effect of treatment with psychopharmacologic agents. In this report we present four patients treated with a combination of different psychotropic drugs, in whom asterixis was triggered either by adding carbamazepine (CBZ) to a treatment regimen, or by increasing its dosage. Neither dosage nor serum levels of CBZ were in a higher range. We consider asterixis to be an easily overlooked sign of neurotoxicity, which may occur even at low or moderate dosage levels, if certain drugs as lithium or clozapine are used in combination with CBZ.",1992,8
341,1422497,Encephalopathy and seizures induced by intravesical alum irrigations.,Hemorrhagic cystitis is a significant toxic effect of cyclophosphamide therapy. Continuous bladder irrigation of a 1% alum solution is a simple and generally safe method of chemical cautery to treat the bleeding urothelium. We report four cases of encephalopathy coincident with elevated aluminum levels as well as one patient who developed seizures while receiving continuous bladder irrigations with alum. All patients had significant renal insufficiency. We recommend the cautious use of alum irrigation in patients with renal impairment and monitoring of serum aluminum levels to prevent excessive accumulation and toxicity.,1992,10
342,1433432,Seizure with hyponatremia in a child prescribed desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis.,We report a case of hyponatremia associated with a grand mal seizure in a 28 month-old child after intra-nasal desmopressin administration for high fluid intake with nocturnal enuresis. In view of the temporary symptomatic action and the seriousness of certain side-effects of desmopressin we recommend that desmopressin be used with caution in childhood enuresis.,1992,0
343,1440123,Suspected inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone in a male with mental retardation.,"The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a disorder in which a sustained release of antidiuretic hormone occurs because of certain diseases, pharmacological agents, or trauma. Fluid volume expands with a resultant hyponatremia which, depending on the degree, may be asymptomatic or result in death. This case report describes a 38-year-old male in whom SIADH was strongly suspected secondary to Tegretol therapy to control a seizure disorder. Medical consultation is imperative for these patients before administering a fluid challenge during general anesthesia.",0,0
344,1445134,Norethisterone and gestational diabetes.,"In a single practice during the 21 years 1971-1991, the incidence of gestational diabetes in pregnancies in which norethisterone was prescribed was 32.4% (22 of 69) in comparison with 7.1% in pregnancies in which the women did not take norethisterone (137 of 1,684) (p < 0.001). Gestational diabetes was no less severe (degree of hyperglycaemia, need for insulin therapy) when associated with norethisterone. However, follow-up revealed that gestational diabetes when associated with norethisterone had a lesser risk of emerging diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance. Masculinization of a female fetus occurred in 5 of 39 (12.8%) exposed to norethisterone; all were cases of clitoral hypertrophy not requiring surgical treatment. Norethisterone in these 69 pregnancies accounted for 33.3% (5 of 15) cases of clitoral hypertrophy diagnosed in 100,756 consecutive births.",1992,8

No cardiovascular disorder with the exception of minor ischemic changes in ECG was revealed before treatment. Recombinant human alpha-interferon (IFN) at a dose of 3 million units combined with melphalan and prednisolone was administrated. Sixteen hours after the first administration of IFN, IFN was suspended by the symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF). Treatment with diuretics and catecholamine products showed almost complete recovery from CHF in 3 weeks. An adverse reaction to IFN was strongly suspected as the cause of CHF.",1992,7
346,14514135,Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis mimicking cutaneous vasculitis in a lupus patient: a complication of cyclophosphamide.,"Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) is an unusual self-limited skin disorder characterized by an inflammatory cell infiltrate in the deep dermis involving the eccrine sweat glands, commonly presenting as painful cutaneous nodules. NEH occurs most frequently in patients receiving chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies. We report a case of NEH masquerading as cutaneous vasculitis in a woman receiving cyclophosphamide for lupus nephritis. The association of NEH and the use of cytotoxic agents for SLE or other autoimmune diseases has not been reported previously. NEH must be considered in lupus patients receiving cytotoxic agents to avoid inappropriate use of corticosteroids or antibiotics in this self-limited condition.",2003,0
347,14522628,Skin rash and splinter hemorrhages from ganciclovir.,"Ganciclovir is a nucleotide-analogue similar to acyclovir, which has an in vitro activity against herpes simplex type 1, herpes simplex type 2 and varicella zoster virus. Numerous studies suggest that ganciclovir has clinical efficacy against cytomegalovirus disease, as well as an in vivo antiviral effect, and that this agent reduces morbidity of serious cytomegalovirus infections in immunocompromised patients. Generalised cutaneous rash associated with ganciclovir therapy has rarely been reported in literature.",2003,9
348,14526130,Can roxithromycin and betamethasone induce acute pancreatitis? A case report.,"Acute pancreatitis has been reported in a few cases treated with macrolides or glucocorticoids.
We report the case of a 58 year old patient who, after 2 days of treatment with roxithromycin and betamethasone, manifested acute pancreatitis. Other causes of the disease were ruled out. No re-occurrence of pancreatitis was observed in a 16 month follow-up.
Our case sheds new light on glucocorticoid pancreatotoxicity and confirms the role of macrolides as potential pancreatotoxic drugs.",2003,9
349,14530108,Renal tubular acidosis secondary to FK506 in living donor liver transplantation: a case report.,"FK506 is an immunosuppressant that is thought to be less nephrotoxic than cyclosporine A. However, complications due to renal tubular acidosis (RTA) have recently been reported. We report a case of RTA secondary to FK506 administration in liver transplantation. A 6-month-old girl was treated with FK506 after undergoing living donor liver transplantation for fulminant hepatitis. On postoperative day 17, she demonstrated hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis; she was diagnosed to have hyperkalaemic distal RTA with aldosterone deficiency (type IV). Intravenous sodium bicarbonate and furosemide, and intrarectal calcium polystyrenesulfonate were administered to correct the acidosis and promote potassium secretion. Thereafter, the FK506 concentration in whole blood gradually decreased, and the hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis following RTA improved. RTA is one type of nephrotoxicity induced by FK506, and it is reversible in mild cases when appropriately treated. The mechanism of RTA induced by FK506 has not yet been clearly elucidated. Surgeons and physicians should therefore be aware of the potential for RTA to occur with FK506 after any organ transplantation. The treatment for acidosis and hyperkalaemia should be started as soon as RTA is diagnosed, and the dosage of FK506 should also be reduced if possible.",2003,10
350,14557583,L-DOPA-induced excessive daytime sleepiness in PD: a placebo-controlled case with MSLT assessment.,"A 74-year-old patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease was evaluated for unintended sleep episodes that occurred after long-term treatment with 400 mg/day of L-dopa. Overnight sleep studies and multiple sleep latency testing were carried out under double-blind administration of either L-dopa or placebo. Mean sleep latency with L-dopa was 7 minutes, in contrast to a normal value of 19 minutes, 25 seconds with placebo. The authors' results suggest that L-dopa may cause daytime somnolence in some patients with Parkinson's disease.",2003,10
351,14561622,Neurotoxicity of intrathecal methotrexate: MR imaging findings.,"We report a case of intrathecal methotrexate neurotoxicity manifesting as left arm weakness and aphasia. Diagnostic imaging showed restricted diffusion and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging findings were normal at presentation. Three weeks later, diffusion abnormalities resolved, and T2-weighted studies showed increased signal intensity of prolonged T2 changes in areas of prior restricted diffusion. We attribute the clinical and radiographic findings to cytotoxic edema secondary to intrathecal methotrexate.",2003,10
352,14566215,Evidence-based mental health use of anticonvulsants during pregnancy.,"There are many pertinent issues surrounding the treatment of bipolar disorder during pregnancy. Unfortunately, while there are numerous observational reports in the literature, there is not a lot of information concerning the safety and efficacy of particular treatments or the nontreatment of bipolar disorder during pregnancy. Much of the existing data comes from the neurology literature regarding epilepsy. In this review, we summarize the available evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of using the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproic acid during pregnancy. The available data suggest that there is a possibility of risk of major malformations with the anticonvulsants. The risk is probably higher with valproic acid than carbamazepine. In this article lithium is not discussed, although there are a number of concerns about lithium's potential teratogenicity, and it has been implicated in Epstein's anomaly, a congenital heart defect among infants born to women taking lithium; as with other medications, however, the data have specific limitations.",2003,0
353,14585456,Effectiveness of octreotide in a case of refractory sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia.,"The use of sulfonylurea medications in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is common. Patients who present to the Emergency Department after ingestion of excessive amounts of suflonylurea medications often have hypoglycemia refractory to dextrose administration. Standard care includes the administration of dextrose, glucagon, and diazoxide. Recently, the use of octreotide has been described as an alternative treatment in these patients. We present a case of a 20-year-old woman who ingested 900 mg of glyburide causing refractory hypoglycemia resistant to treatment with intravenous dextrose, glucagon, and diazoxide. Octreotide administration rapidly reversed hypoglycemia allowing patient stabilization and eventual discharge without any significant adverse events.",2003,10
354,14601701,Ocular ethambutol toxicity.,"Ethambutol is an antimicrobial agent used frequently to treat tuberculosis. The most commonly recognized toxic effect of ethambutol is optic neuropathy, which generally is considered uncommon and reversible in medical literature. We describe a 43-year-old man who developed signs and symptoms of bilateral optic neuropathy during treatment with ethambutol. This case and a review of the literature show the severe and unpredictable nature of ethambutol toxicity and its potential for irreversible vision loss despite careful ophthalmologic monitoring.",2003,11
355,14607011,Fatal cold medication intoxication in an infant.,"The case history and toxicological findings of an infant fatality involving pseudoephedrine, brompheniramine, and dextromethorphan are presented. Concentrations of brompheniramine and dextromethorphan were measured in both postmortem blood and liver specimens using a gas chromatograph equipped with a nitrogen-phosphorus detector. Brompheniramine and dextromethorphan were 0.40 mg/L and 0.50 mg/L, respectively, in the blood sample and 0.16 mg/kg and 0.57 mg/kg in the liver sample. The concentration of pseudoephedrine in blood and liver specimens was measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and was determined to be 14.4 mg/L in the blood and 16 mg/kg in the liver. Additionally, a baby bottle allegedly administered to the infant was collected as evidence and sent to the Medical Examiner's Office for evaluation. The amounts of total brompheniramine, dextromethorphan, and pseudoephedrine remaining in the baby bottle were 1.4 mg, 9.4 mg, and 40 mg, respectively.",2003,10
356,14614357,Early overanticoagulation with acenocoumarol due to a genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 CYP2C9.,We report the case of a young healthy woman who presented an early overanticoagulation when receiving acenocoumarol for a first thromboembolic episode. The patient had none of the risk factors known to influence the response to the coumarinic derivative except that she carried the rare *3 allelic variant of the cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 in a homozygous status. This case illustrates the role of the *3 polymorphism of the cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 as an independent risk factor modulating the sensitivity of patients to the anticoagulant effect of acenocoumarol. The usefulness of CYP2C9 genotyping before starting coumarinic treatments is discussed.,2003,12
357,14632592,Colchicine-induced myopathy in a teenager with familial Mediterranean fever.,"To report a case of colchicine-induced myopathy in a teenager with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).
A 15-year-old boy of Turkish origin, diagnosed as having FMF at the age of 14 years, was treated with colchicine 1.5 mg/d. He had experienced only 2 mild peritonitis attacks with fever within 1 year. The patient used the recommended dose regularly, and he described progressive proximal muscle weakness and generalized myalgias, which started 1 month before presentation. Physical examination showed proximal muscle weakness in his arms and legs. Laboratory tests revealed elevated serum creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase. All other laboratory values were within normal range. Electromyographic investigation revealed a myopathic pattern in proximal muscles without any neuropathic changes. A biopsy of the deltoid muscle showed vacuolar degeneration of striated muscle fibers with no inflammatory findings.
Colchicine, the most important drug in treatment of FMF, can cause myopathy in patients with impaired renal and hepatic function. In our patient, an objective causality scale showed that therapeutic doses of colchicine for FMF were the definite cause of myopathy, even though his renal and hepatic function were normal. The treatment of FMF attacks in patients who cannot use colchicine is an important problem. There are insufficient data about the use of immunosuppressive agents in the treatment of FMF attacks; however, we now successfully control the attacks with colchicine 0.5 mg/d and azathioprine 2 mg/kg/d.
Colchicine-induced myopathy should be excluded in patients with FMF who present with generalized muscle weakness. Clinicians should be aware that myopathy can occur in patients with FMF who have normal renal and hepatic function.",2003,12
358,14641354,Angioedema and dysphagia caused by contact allergy to inhaled budesonide.,"Inhaled corticosteroids may cause various adverse effects ranging from irritation to severe anaphylactic reactions and systemic contact dermatitis. We report a 43-year-old woman who developed sore throat, swelling of the lips and oral cavity and dysphagia, 2 weeks after the use of budesonide spray (Budefat) for treatment of bronchial asthma. The symptoms occurred with a delay of 3-4 h after the treatment x2 daily. There were no immediate reactions on prick and intracutaneous testing with the commercial product used by the patient. However, marked pruritic infiltration developed within 24 h, progressing to coalescing eczematous lesions over the following 2 days. In addition, severe oedema of the right upper eyelid was observed. On patch testing, budesonide was strongly positive at day 2 and 3 in a concentration ranging from 1% to 10 p.p.m. (in petrolatum). Other corticosteroids of group A, B, C and D were completely negative. Repeated open application tests with amcinonide and triamcinolone acetonide cream on the ventral aspect of the upper arm were negative. Bronchial exposure to alternative sprays containing beclomethasone dipropionate (group D), fluticasone-17- propionate (D) and dexamethasone-21-isonicotinate (C) was well tolerated. In conclusion, this case is instructive, because the symptoms which developed after a short period of corticosteroid inhalation suggested a type I allergy. Testing proved a severe type IV contact allergy restricted to budesonide (group B), without cross-reactions to major corticosteroids of other groups.",2003,8
359,14660304,Infectious toxicity of dexamethasone during all remission-induction chemotherapy: report of two cases and literature review.,"Traditionally, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receive prednisone, as part of multiagent remission-induction chemotherapy. Recently, many cooperative groups use dexamethasone instead of prednisone during induction. We describe the infectious toxicities experienced by the first two patients in our institution treated with dexamethasone (10 mg/m(2)/day for 4 weeks with gradual tapering) during induction according to the dexamethasone arm of BFM 2000 and review the relevant literature that suggests an increased risk of infectious complications with dexamethasone. Only a prospective two-arm ALL dexamethasone study at two dose levels (6 and 10 mg/m(2)/day) will clarify if indeed the higher dose of dexamethasone during induction is more effective and without unacceptable toxicity.",0,0

Rapid diagnosis may avert unnecessary changes in therapy to treat conditions which clinically mimic NEH. We describe a patient who developed NEH on three separate occasions provoked by two different chemotherapeutic agents--cytarabine and mitoxantrone. The lesions were morphologically distinct and differed in their anatomical distribution during each episode. The response to intravenous corticosteroids was dramatic, but lesions recurred after their withdrawal. This case illustrates the potential diversity of clinical lesions in a single patient with NEH, and its response to systemically administered corticosteroids.",1992,11
361,14674674,Infliximab-induced lupus in Crohn's disease: a case report.,"An 18-year-old male patient was under treatment with infliximab at a dose of 5 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 2 and 6 for refractory Crohn's disease. In June 2002, the patient was admitted to the Outpatient Clinic of the Rheumatology Unit for arthralgia affecting the small joints, non-pruritic crops of purple skin lesions and malar rash in the face. Serum antinuclear antibodies were positive (1:640 speckled pattern), and anti-double-stranded DNA was positive (1:80); moreover, positivity of anti-extractable nuclear antigen was observed. Antihistone antibodies, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. A diagnosis of infliximab-induced lupus was made and the drug treatment was withdrawn. However, 3 months after withdrawal of treatment, the patient still showed clinical and laboratory symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus. After 6 months of treatment, systemic lupus erythematosus-related symptoms disappeared and anti-double-stranded DNA returned to normal. The patient is currently under treatment with prednisone 20 mg/day for systemic lupus erythematosus and with oral mesalazine 2.4 mg/day for Crohn's disease. Treatment with infliximab is known to produce an increase of autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA), but not clinical disease. This is the first case, to our knowledge, of onset of prolonged infliximab-induced lupus.",2003,11

363,14684937,"Iatrogenic hypercalcemia due to vitamin D3 ointment (1,24(OH)2D3) combined with thiazide diuretics in a case of psoriasis.","Tacalcitol is a synthetic vitamin D3 analogue developed for topical treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis. Hypercalcemia has not been previously reported during treatment with topical tacalcitol. We experienced a male patient with psoriasis and hypertension whose conditions were treated with tacalcitol ointment and thiazide, respectively, resulting in hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia. After initiation of topical vitamin D3 ointment (20 micro g/g of tacalcitol) 10 g/day for the skin lesions, both the serum level of calcium and urinary excretion of calcium increased gradually. On day 28 of the treatment, his serum calcium levels had reached 3.55 mmol/l, and his urinary calcium excretion had also increased from 0.008 g/day to 0.475 g/day. The tacalcitol treatment was terminated, seven days later, the serum calcium level had returned to the reference range without any specific treatment.

364,14690166,2-Chloro-deoxyadenosine induces durable complete remission in Castleman's disease but may accelerate its transformation to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.,"There is currently no consensus on the best treatment for unresectable hyaline-vascular variant or for multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD), because none of the reported regimens have consistently produced complete response or durable remission in the majority of patients In the present study, we report on the use of 2-CdA (2-chloro-deoxyadenosine) in three patients, two of them with MCD and one with unresectable hyaline-vascular type disease. Relapse-free survival of the responding patients was 24 and 20 months. Later, both patients evolved to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell NHL, respectively). 2-CdA typically causes a long-lasting state of immunodeficiency and the profound influence of this drug on the immune system has raised questions concerning the emergence of secondary neoplasms after its use. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that: 1) 2-CdA can induce durable complete remission in MCD patients but unfortunately it cannot cure the disease; 2) the possibility that 2-CdA may accelerate the transformation of MCD to NHL cannot be ruled out.",2003,0
365,1469187,Treatment of a patient with severe digitoxin intoxication by Fab fragments of anti-digitalis antibodies.,"A massive digitoxin (DGTX) intoxication in a 36-year-old man (35 mg DGTX) was treated by prolonged and repeated i.v.-infusions of Fab fragments of anti-digitalis antibodies (FAB). Blood and urine samples were collected over a 98 h period for monitoring the efficacy and adequacy of FAB treatment. DGTX concentrations were determined after protein precipitation (release of FAB-bound and protein-bound DGTX) in unprocessed serum and urine samples, and after aliquots of these samples had been dialysed in vitro against DGTX-free buffer (elimination of DGTX not bound to FAB). The difference in DGTX concentration between the unprocessed and dialysed samples was the amount of DGTX bound to plasma proteins and the small fraction of unbound DGTX being relevant for the therapeutic and toxic effects of the drug. Before FAB therapy was started, the total serum DGTX concentration was 535 nmol/l. The first FAB infusion (320 mg) was started 11 h after drug ingestion. Since this amount of FAB was insufficient to bind all DGTX present in the serum, cardiac DGTX toxicity (total AV-block) persisted. During a second FAB infusion (400 mg) the patient reverted to regular AV-conduction. At this time most of the DGTX in serum was FAB-bound. Toxic symptoms (sinus arrest) reappeared twice and were accompanied by increasing amounts of non-antibody-bound DGTX in the serum. Additional application of FAB (2 x 80 mg) resulted in the immediate disappearance of arrhythmia. During FAB-treatment total DGTX serum concentrations and renal DGTX clearance rose, indicating redistribution of drug from tissue to serum and urinary elimination of FAB-bound DGTX, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1992,0
366,14693027,Erythema multiforme associated with phenytoin and cranial radiation therapy: a report of three patients and review of the literature.,"Intracranial malignancies (primary and metastatic) are often complicated by seizure activity. Phenytoin (Dilantin) is typically employed as prophylactic anticonvulsant in this setting. Uncommonly, erythema multiforme (EM) can develop in such patients at the port site during or soon after cranial radiation and can rapidly progress to EM major. Herein, in addition to a comprehensive literature review of this entity, three additional patients are presented. The acronym 'EMPACT' is suggested (E: erythema; M: multiforme; associated with P: phenytoin; A: and; C: cranial, radiation; T: therapy) to best describe this disorder.
An extensive review of the English medical literature through the National Library of Medicine (PUBMED) was performed to identify patients who had received or continued to receive radiation therapy while on phenytoin. A total of 24 patients were identified and clinical information of varying detail was available in all cases. Clinical and histological information on three additional patients seen at two institutions (Rochester Methodist Hospital, Rochester, MN, and Fairview-University Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN) by the authors were also compiled.
The mean age was 44 years (range: 23-67) and no sexual predisposition was noted. All patients had taken phenytoin for variable time periods (range 16-80 days; mean: 40) and were on the medication when the skin lesions first appeared. These lesions developed within the port site during the radiation treatments (11 cases) or soon after (nine cases) its completion (mean: 16 days; range: 2-35). Subsequent disease evolution to EM major occurred in all cases (Stevens-Johnsons syndrome developed in 73% of patients). No relationship was identified between the extent and the severity of the skin lesions with the phenytoin and radiation dosages and with the histologic type and origin of the intracranial malignancy. None of the patients demonstrated the requisite features of the 'Dilantin hypersensitivity syndrome'. Although, a systemic steroid taper was employed in 10 out of the 14 patients before the development of the skin lesions, the subsequent progression of the skin lesions was not influenced by the use of systemic steroid therapy. Complete recovery occurred in all but two patients typically within 1-8 weeks of discontinuation of phenytoin.
The need for prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy especially utilizing phenytoin in patients undergoing cranial radiation therapy should be assessed on a case by case basis. If anticonvulsants are employed, then they must be administered with caution, and all cutaneous reactions developing subsequently within the radiation site must be promptly evaluated with a high index of suspicion for erythema multiforme.",2004,1
367,14697943,Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome in renal transplanted patients under immunosuppression with tacrolimus.,"Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS), which probably has a multifactorial etiology, may appear after kidney transplantation. Its clinical manifestations include severe periarticular pain with inflammatory signs, especially in knees and ankles, causing functional disability. Symptoms develop during the first 3 months after transplantation and usually disappear 3 to 6 months later without sequelae. In renal transplant recipients it has previously been related to immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine. Therefore we had suggested that introducing tacrolimus could be a therapeutic option. We now present four cases of RSDS in kidney transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus. All but one patient were receiving tacrolimus monotherapy, excluding other drugs that might have been involved to cause the syndrome. It is also interesting that one of our cases develop RSDS long after transplantation when immunosuppressive treatment was changed. Symptoms correlated with an increase in alkaline phosphatase and with bone scintigraphy findings. All patients recovered without sequels 3 to 6 months afterward. In conclusion, RSDS is a relevant osteoarticular complication in patients receiving either anticalcineurinic drug (CyA or tacrolimus), even under monotherapy or with a low steroid dose.",2003,12
368,14700673,Mechanism of topiramate-induced acute-onset myopia and angle closure glaucoma.,"Interventional case report.
In an institutional practice setting, two women, aged 25 and 45, developed acute myopia after starting topiramate for epilepsy. One patient also developed bilateral angle closure glaucoma.
Topiramate was discontinued. Anterior chamber shallowing was noted in both patients at presentation. Ultrasonography showed ciliochoroidal effusion. Baseline measurements of anterior chamber depth and lens thickness were obtained.
Topiramate may be associated with ciliochoroidal effusion with forward displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm and anterior chamber shallowing, resulting in acute myopia and angle-closure glaucoma. Increased lens thickness contributes only minimally (9%-16%) to anterior chamber shallowing.",2004,1

370,14723711,A new type of minocycline-induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation.,"Pigmentary disorders are recognized adverse effects of the semi-synthetic tetracycline derivative antibiotic, minocycline. Three distinct types of minocycline-induced cutaneous pigmentation have been described. Type I, blue-black pigmentation confined to sites of scarring or inflammation on the face; Type II, blue-grey circumscribed pigmentation of normal skin of the lower legs and forearms; and Type III, diffuse muddy brown pigmentation of normal skin accentuated in sun-exposed areas. We report two patients with acne vulgaris with a fourth type of minocycline-induced cutaneous pigmentation. They presented with circumscribed blue-grey pigmentation within acne scars confined to the back. Histology showed pigment within dendritic cells, and extracellularly throughout the dermis. Histochemistry identified a calcium containing melanin-like substance. Iron was absent. Immunohistochemistry confirmed some pigment-containing cells to be macrophages. Electron microscopy demonstrated electron-dense granules, free and membrane-bound, within macrophages and fibroblast-like cells. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis confirmed the presence of calcium. Iron was absent. This fourth type of cutaneous minocycline hyperpigmentation may be a variant of Type I, but based on clinical, pathological and microanalytical differences, appears to be a new entity. The pigment may be a drug metabolite-protein complex chelated with calcium, or an insoluble minocycline-melanin complex. We propose a classification of cutaneous minocycline pigmentation based on clinico-pathological criteria.",2004,1

A 56-year-old Caucasian man who received concomitant chemotherapy and radiation for head and neck cancer developed fever concurrent with the administration of amifostine. To our knowledge, this is the first case report that demonstrates the occurrence of fever with low-dose amifostine therapy without the manifestation of accompanying rash or hypotension. Patients receiving amifostine who develop only fever should be evaluated for an adverse drug reaction, as well as for sepsis and fevers of neutropenia, and it may be necessary to discontinue the drug. Recognition of amifostine as the cause of this adverse event may prevent the cost and inconvenience of a hospital admission.",2004,1

A 77-year-old white woman presented to the hospital with elevated serum creatinine, oliguria for the past 24 hours, arthralgia, fatigue, fever, and bilateral flank pain. The patient had initiated treatment with oral pantoprazole 40 mg/d for gastroesophageal reflux 2 months prior to admission. After 5 weeks of therapy, she stopped taking pantoprazole due to general malaise. Upon admission, all home medications, including pantoprazole, were reinitiated based on the patient's medication list. Serum creatinine increased to 6.1 mg/dL on day 4 of admission from a baseline of 1.0 mg/dL. Pantoprazole therapy was promptly discontinued, and prednisone 40 mg/d was initiated. Urinalysis revealed eosinophils, and a subsequent renal biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of AIN. The serum creatinine level gradually declined over 2 weeks, and the patient was discharged home with a serum creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. The Naranjo probability scale suggests a highly probable relationship between AIN and pantoprazole therapy in this patient.
Drug hypersensitivity reactions are the most common cause of AIN. There have been several reported cases of omeprazole-induced AIN. Although there are very few prospective data on the efficacy of treatment of drug-induced AIN, corticosteroids may have a role in recovery of renal function. Prednisone doses of 1 mg/kg/d have been suggested.
Physicians should be aware that drug-induced AIN can be associated with proton-pump inhibitors. Early detection of this rare adverse reaction may prevent acute renal insufficiency.",2004,1
374,14746605,Propecia-associated bilateral cataract.,"A 43-year-old man presented suffering from decreasing vision in both eyes for 3 months. The patient's visual acuity was 6/20 (non-corrected) in the right eye and 6/10 (-1.75/-1.00 x 91) in the left. Ocular examination of both eyes revealed anterior subcapsular opacities of both lenses with the right eye being more severe than the left. He had been taking finasteride (Propecia; Merck, Sharp and Dohme) at 1 mg/day for 3 years to treat early stage of androgenic alopecia. It was highly suspected that finasteride was associated with the anterior subcapsular opacity on the lens, and the patient therefore discontinued use of finasteride. He underwent uneventful cataract extraction surgery and intraocular lens implantation of the right eye. One month after cataract surgery in the right eye, the best-corrected visual acuity was right 6/6 (-1.25) and left 6/10 (-2.00/-0.50 x 100). To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of Propecia-associated cataract.",2004,2
375,14760958,Scleromyxedema in a patient with multiple sclerosis and monoclonal gammopathy on interferon beta-1a.,"Animal studies have shown that some human monoclonal antibodies promote myelin repair in models of demyelinating disease. Scleromyxedema is a dermatologic disorder associated with a monoclonal gammopathy and neurologic manifestations. The reason for occurrence of cutaneous reactions in interferon treated patients is unknown.
A 37-year-old woman was started on weekly interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a) following a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). After having been on interferon therapy for three years, she developed skin lesions secondary to scleromyxedema. Her IFN beta-1a was discontinued and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was started for her scleromyxedema. At a six-month follow up, her skin lesions improved and there was no recurrence of neurologic symptoms.
This is the first report of occurrence of scleromyxedema in a patient with MS. While this could be a chance association, it does raise the question if her neurologic manifestations could be secondary to scleromyxedema. Further research into the mechanism of IFN related cutaneous side effects is needed. Evidence regarding the remyelinating nature of human monoclonal antibodies raises interest in the potential therapeutic role these antibodies may have.",2004,2
376,1477441,Fixed drug eruption of the scrotum due to methylphenidate.,"To report two cases of fixed drug eruption induced by methylphenidate.
Two children with attention deficit disorder treated with methylphenidate as a simple drug developed fixed drug eruption of the scrotum. Drug discontinuation was followed by a complete resolution of the skin eruption. Rechallenge resulted in the same drug rash. Macrophage migration-inhibiting factor (MIF) assay with methylphenidate was positive.
The pathogenesis of fixed drug eruption and the role of MIF assay in the diagnosis of adverse drug reaction is discussed.
Fixed drug rash induced by methylphenidate is a possible but rare phenomenon.",1992,11
377,1495728,Methotrexate pneumonitis in nonsurgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy.,"We describe a case of pneumonitis following local administration of methotrexate for nonsurgical termination of an ectopic pregnancy. The signs and symptoms were similar to those seen with systemic use of the drug for other ailments. We believe that methotrexate represents a relatively effective alternative to surgery in patients with early unruptured tubal pregnancy, but suggest that it be used with caution in view of possible systemic toxicity.",1992,9
378,14960440,Warfarin-associated thoracic aortic dissection in an elderly woman.,"The risk/benefit ratio of warfarin therapy changes in the over 75s, when haemorrhagic side-effects become more common. These may not always be reported in the literature.
A woman of 80 years, on long-term warfarin therapy presented with an acute dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm; on investigation the only precipitating factor found was an international normalised ratio of 4.8. This patient, who also had an abdominal aortic aneurysm, survived, on discontinuation of her anticoagulant therapy.
We describe a previously unreported complication of warfarin therapy in a patient over 75 years of age, to add to the cautions in prescribing this drug in patients of this age group.",2004,3
379,14964753,Cutaneous vasculitis secondary to ramipril.,"A 61-year-old patient who had been treated with lisinopril in the past without any problems was commenced on ramipril for left ventricular dysfunction. He developed a painful symmetrical purpuric eruption over both feet after three days. A full vasculitis screen was negative. Ramipril was stopped and he required a course of steroids after which the rash improved slowly. The ACE inhibitors can cause various skin side effects; however, it rarely causes cutaneous vasculitis. Ramipril-induced cutaneous vasculitis is particularly rare and our case was atypical because the patient had tolerated lisinopril before. Previous successful treatment with one ACE inhibitor does not rule out the vasculitis caused by the drug from the same group. Here we report ramipril-induced cutaneous vasculitis in a patient who required steroid therapy to control it.",0,0
380,14968106,Neurological improvement and rehabilitation potential following toxic myelopathy due to intrathecal injection of doxorubicin.,"Case report of a 31-year-old woman who presented with toxic myelopathy due to intrathecal administration of doxorubicin.
To describe the pathology and the rehabilitation of an uncommon complication of intrathecal drug administration during the oncologic treatment of acute lymphoma.
Spinal cord rehabilitation center, University Hospital.
Clinical and radiological observations during a rehabilitation program.
Evidence of neurological improvement and rehabilitation potential after severe myelopathy due to intrathecal injection of doxorubicin.

381,14971874,Worsening of obstructive sleep apnoeas in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor.,"We report on a case of an adult patient treated for rheumatoid arthritis with infliximab, a chimerical monoclonal antibody to TNFalpha. Apart from this, the patient also showed clinical signs of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome that was confirmed by polysomnographic study. After infliximab treatment, additional sleep studies revealed an increase in the number of apneic events and SaO2 dips suggesting that TNFalpha plays an important role in the pathophysiology of sleep apnea. Thus, clinical recognition of sleep disordered breathing should be taken into account when rheumatoid arthritis patients are to be treated with infliximab.",2004,2
382,14996269,Hypernatraemia induced by sodium polystyrene sulphonate (Kayexalate) in two extremely low birth weight newborns.,"Hyperkalaemia is a life-threatening electrolyte disorder that can occur in the first week of life in almost 50% of preterm infants with a birth weight less than 1000 g [extremely low birth weight (ELBW)]. Serum potassium values higher than 7 mmol x l-1 are associated with cardiac arrhythmias and an increased incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage and periventricular leucomalacia. Therapeutic options to treat this dangerous imbalance comprise calcium gluconate, insulin plus glucose, albuterol/salbutamol inhalation. Administration of cation-exchange resin such as sodium polystyrene sulphonate (Kayexalate) is effective in lowering plasma potassium, although complications following oral or rectal administration are reported in newborns. We describe two ELBW infants affected by hyperkalaemia, treated with Kayexalate, who developed serious hypernatraemia, that has never been reported before in preterm infants.",2004,3
383,15013892,Bull's-eye maculopathy associated with quinacrine therapy for malaria.,"To report a side effect of quinacrine therapy for malaria.
Case report.
Review of clinical chart and photographs.
Private retina practice.
A patient developed a bilaterally symmetric bull's-eye maculopathy 45 years after taking quinacrine for 18 months as prophylaxis against malaria. Progression of the clinical picture was documented over 15 years of follow-up. The clinical picture was identical to that of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine maculopathy.
Low dosages of quinacrine used for malaria prophylaxis can be associated with a delayed, severe maculopathy indistinguishable from chloroquine maculopathy in certain patients.",2004,3
384,15028328,"Cerebral infarcts in a pediatric patient secondary to phenylpropanolamine, a recalled medication.","Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) recently has been publicly implicated as a cause of stroke and other neurologic events. In November of 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested a voluntary recall of the product from all manufacturers. However, medications containing PPA still can be found in many homes of those unaware of the voluntary recall. We present a case of stroke after PPA ingestion that occurred 4 months after the recall in an 8-year-old boy on chronic peritoneal dialysis. The patient developed occipital infarcts and was found to have extremely elevated levels of PPA in his blood and dialysis fluid. Though the voluntary recall was in effect, the family already had a bottle of the medication at home. Physicians must be aware that the public is still ingesting the drug and remain rigorous in including its toxicity in the differential diagnosis of acute neurologic events.",2004,4
385,1504404,Ciprofloxacin-induced psychosis.,"To report a case of ciprofloxacin-induced psychosis and to discuss occurrence rates, risk factors, possible etiologies, preventive measures, and treatment courses for this adverse reaction.
Case reports and review articles identified by MEDLINE.
Data from pertinent published sources were reviewed and abstracted.
A 49-year-old man developed symptoms of severe psychosis concomitant with ciprofloxacin (250 mg bid) treatment. Central nervous system effects secondary to ciprofloxacin treatment are uncommon and usually consist only of minor dizziness or mild headache, although rare occurrences of seizures and hallucinations have been reported. The mechanism by which ciprofloxacin causes these adverse effects is not fully understood. It has been suggested that quinolones may produce an epileptogenic effect by inhibiting the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid to its receptor sites in the brain. There is yet no explanation for the occurrence of hallucinations or psychosis.
Caution should be exercised when using ciprofloxacin in the treatment of patients with personality abnormalities or symptoms of psychosis.",0,0
386,15053046,Agranulocytosis induced by vancomycin in an ESRD patient on CAPD.,"Agranulocytosis is a rare adverse effect associated with prolonged vancomycin therapy, and is potentially serious, especially in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. We describe a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patient that developed vancomycin-induced agranulocytosis during treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-associated external cuff infection and pneumonia. The agranulocytosis was rapidly resolved by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy and by the discontinuation of vancomycin.",2004,3
387,15061230,Osteonecrosis in patients with testicular tumours treated with chemotherapy.,"The role of antiemetics is invaluable in allowing cancer patients to complete, otherwise possibly intolerable, chemotherapy. In the Perugia Consensus Conference it was decided that the recommended antiemetic regimen in the prevention of acute emesis induced by a single high, low and repeated doses of cisplatin is a serotonin receptor antagonist plus dexamethasone. We describe three testicular cancer patients who were cured with chemotherapy but developed bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head 17, 22 and 55 months after chemotherapy. It is very likely that the dexamethasone used in the antiemetic drug regimen contributed to the development of osteonecrosis in these patients. Osteonecrosis is a serious side effect of antiemetic treatment with dexamethasone and this serious complication should be incorporated in the current guidelines. Patients should be informed about the risk of osteonecrosis when taking dexamethasone as an antiemetic drug. A recommendation to add corticosteroids to serotonin receptor antagonists only after demonstrated nausea in chemotherapy regimes with low-dose cisplatin (20 mg/m2) for five days seems justified.",2004,1
388,15072497,Development of Peyronie's disease during long-term colchicine treatment.,"Colchicine has been reported to be a safe and effective medication in the treatment of early phase of Peyronie's disease (PD).

389,150825,Cholestatic hepatitis after administration of furan derivatives.,A patient developed cholestatic hepatitis while being treated with nitrofurantoin. A second episode of jaundice followed the intravaginal administration of a mixture of furazolidone and nifuroxime. It is important to consider possible cross-sensitivity of chemically related compounds even when they are administered by different routes.,1975,5
390,1509179,A case of phenobarbital exacerbation of a preexisting maladaptive behavior partially suppressed by chlorpromazine and misinterpreted as chlorpromazine efficacy.,"An adult female with developmental disability was prescribed chlorpromazine for the target behaviors of aggression and self-injurious behavior (SIB), and she was prescribed phenobarbital for seizures. Upon a chlorpromazine minimal effective dose reduction, target behaviors increased and dosage was returned to prior levels with the conclusion that chlorpromazine was controlling the target behaviors. Upon subsequent reduction and discontinuation of phenobarbital, however, chlorpromazine was able to be reduced with no increase in target behaviors. Ten years of behavioral data are presented to support the hypothesis that phenobarbital was exacerbating maladaptive behaviors. Given tardive dyskinesia (TD), clinicians and interdisciplinary teams should remain alert to the following client profile: (1) prescribed phenobarbital (or primidone), (2) prescribed neuroleptics, especially at high dosages, to control maladaptive behaviors, (3) failure of neuroleptic gradual minimal effective dose attempts, and (4) possible presence of behavioral procedures, especially intrusive procedures, to control maladaptive behaviors. This profile should trigger a ""red flag"" as to the possibility of phenobarbital behavioral side effects or exacerbation of preexisting maladaptive behaviors.",1992,0
391,15093850,Pilocarpine toxicity and the treatment of xerostomia.,"Pilocarpine has been used as an ophthalmologic agent for decades; however, toxicity rarely has been reported in the medical literature. Oral pilocarpine tablets, as well as another muscarinic agent (cevimeline), have recently been approved for the treatment of dry mouth (xerostomia). We report a case of unintentional overdose of oral pilocarpine tablets that resulted in bradycardia, mild hypotension, and muscarinic symptoms in a patient with Sjogren's syndrome. The patient's symptoms were relieved with 0.5 mg intravenous atropine and she recovered uneventfully. The case is unique in that it is the first reported ingestion of oral pilocarpine tablets and the first dosing error reported for this indication. In addition, this case underscores the importance of communication between physician and patient and the resulting toxicity related to miscommunication.",2004,5
392,15097937,"Anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome associated with Bellamine S, a therapy for menopausal symptoms.","Anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is a rare, potentially fatal, idiosyncratic drug reaction characterized by fever, morbilliform rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Aromatic antiepileptic agents, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital are the most frequent causes of this syndrome. We report a case of a previously healthy, postmenopausal woman who developed anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome while taking Bellamine S (belladonna alkaloids; ergotamine; phenobarbital) for hot flashes. Although combinations of belladonna, ergotamine, and phenobarbital have been used for medical treatment of menopausal symptoms since the 1960s, this is the first known case report of its association with anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome. Given the current debate about the risks of hormonal replacement therapy, more women are seeking alternative therapies for menopausal symptoms. Dermatologists need to be aware of this potential serious reaction to this phenobarbital-containing therapy for hot flashes.",2004,5

394,15112258,Gemcitabine-related radiation recall preferentially involves internal tissue and organs.,"Radiation recall refers to inflammatory reactions triggered by cytotoxic agents and develops in previously irradiated areas. Most reactions develop cutaneously. The most common chemotherapeutic agents implicated are anthracyclines and taxanes. Gemcitabine, a nucleotide analog, recently was implicated in several cases. The authors performed a literature search using PubMed and the search terms ""gemcitabine"" and ""radiation recall"" to find prior cases of radiation recall attributed to gemcitabine. These cases were compared with those attributed to anthracyclines and taxanes. The literature search found 12 cases of radiation recall caused by gemcitabine. The authors also determined that their case of myositis developing in the rectus abdominus muscle of a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma was the manifestation of radiation recall, thereby bringing the number of patients who developed radiation recall to gemcitabine and were discussed in the current study to 13. Approximately 70% of the cases manifested as inflammation of internal organs or tissues and 30% manifested as a dermatitis or mucositis. This finding differs from other common agents, in which 63% of the radiation recall events are reported to manifest as a dermatitis. Compared with anthracyclines and taxanes, the interval from the completion of radiation therapy to the initiation of chemotherapy is less for gemcitabine (median time of 56 days for gemcitabine, compared with 218 days for the taxanes and 646 days for doxorubicin). The majority of radiation recall reactions attributed to gemcitabine are reported to affect internal tissue or organs. In contrast, other common agents for the most part trigger cutaneous inflammation. The development of internal tissue inflammation is reportedly correlated with a shorter interval from the time of completion of radiation therapy to the initiation of chemotherapy.",2004,5
395,15126179,Cystoid macular edema in a low-risk patient after switching from latanoprost to bimatoprost.,"To report a case of angiographically documented cystoid macula edema occurring after switching a pseudophakic patient from latanoprost to bimatoprost.
Observational case report.
A 68-year-old man developed intense conjunctival hyperemia and cystoid macula edema after switching from latanoprost to bimatoprost 9 months after cataract surgery in an eye at low-risk for this cystoid macular edema.
Bimatoprost was discontinued and diclofenac initiated. After 2 months, visual acuity and ocular hyperemia returned to baseline levels. Fundus examination revealed resolution of cystoid macula edema.
It is possible that pseudophakic eyes that develop intense conjunctival hyperemia associated with ocular hypotensive lipids might be at higher risk for developing cystoid macula edema.",2004,5
396,15157248,An immediate hemolytic reaction induced by repeated administration of oxaliplatin.,"Platinum-based chemotherapy agents have been associated with potentially fatal acute immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. The target antigen, cause of the positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and mechanism of hemolysis have been the subject of controversy.
We report a patient who developed a DAT-positive hemolytic episode after a red cell (RBC) transfusion was delivered during the infusion of her 17th cycle of oxaliplatin. Standard pretransfusion testing was uncomplicated; however, after infusion, the serum was no longer compatible with the transfused units and a strong (4+) panreactive IgG antibody was detected.
The patient's serum from 10 days after the episode, only when therapeutic concentrations of oxaliplatin were added, reacted with all RBCs tested using the indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) (3+). The effect was retained with a purified IgG fraction and almost eliminated with IgG-depleted serum. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a band with the molecular weight of the Band 3 anion channel only in the presence of the patient's serum and oxaliplatin.
Our investigations indicated that oxaliplatin interacted with both an IgG antibody and a RBC membrane epitope probably located on the Band 3 anion channel.",2004,6
397,15162903,Fatal acute encephalomyelitis after a single dose of intrathecal methotrexate.,"A 40-year-old Hispanic man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was treated with a single dose of intrathecal methotrexate 12 mg for prophylaxis against leptomeningeal spread of tumor. The day after methotrexate administration, the patient complained of severe back pain and urinary retention. The diagnosis of encephalomyelitis was made on day 3 after methotrexate administration, and by day 6 mechanical ventilation was begun secondary to ascending paralysis. By day 8 the patient was comatose, with minimal signs of brain activity and little hope for recovery; on day 12 he died. Although neurotoxicity is a frequent complication of methotrexate therapy, fatal acute neurotoxicity is extremely uncommon, especially in adults. The mechanisms of methotrexate toxicity remain unclear, and no effective treatment exists to prevent its occurrence. This patient rapidly progressed from mild neurotoxicity to fatal encephalopathy after one dose of intrathecal methotrexate during his third cycle of chemotherapy. Clinicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of neurotoxicity during treatment, as well as predisposing factors that put patients receiving methotrexate at risk for neurotoxic effects.",2004,5
398,1517501,Toxic epidermal necrolysis in early infancy.,"Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a life-threatening bullous dermatosis characterized by the sudden onset of full-thickness epidermal necrosis. TEN is a disease of both children and adults, but TEN in early infancy is a rare event; only two well-documented cases in infants less than 6 months of age have been reported. We report a third case of a 6-week-old infant with Escherichia coli sepsis who received ampicillin and other antibiotics and subsequently developed TEN. Despite the withdrawal of ampicillin and aggressive systemic and wound care, the infant died. The infants in the other two reported cases also died, which suggests that TEN in early infancy has an extremely poor prognosis.",1992,8
399,15176542,Heparin therapy for mistaken cardiac diagnosis in Boerhaave's syndrome.,We describe two patients with Boerhaave's syndrome who presented with chest pain mimicking cardiac pain and received heparin therapy.

Both were managed conservatively.,0,0
400,15183980,Eosinophilic cystitis after bladder instillation with dimethyl sulfoxide.,"Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare and poorly understood disorder. We report the first case of an acute flare of eosinophilic cystitis in a 51-year-old woman after bladder instillation with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for presumed interstitial cystitis. The patient presented with severe bladder pain, fever, and eosinophilia several hours after instillation. These symptoms were unresponsive to conventional analgesic and antibiotic treatments. Cystoscopy revealed erythema and exudate at the bladder walls, along with edema of both ureteral orifices. Bladder biopsies demonstrated massive eosinophilic infiltration of the bladder, confirming the diagnosis of eosinophilic cystitis. Urologists should bear in mind this clinical entity, particularly when DMSO is administered to patients with multiple drug allergies.",2004,6
401,15190230,Acute dystonia during pegylated interferon alpha therapy in a case with chronic hepatitis B infection.,"Interferon (IFN) is the most widely prescribed drug of choice for chronic hepatitis B infection, which is a common health problem in our country. Therapy with IFN-alpha may be associated with a number of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as Parkinsonism, akathisia, seizure, and depressive disorders. In this case report, we present clinical and laboratory findings of a case with chronic hepatitis B that developed acute dystonia soon after the first dose of pegylated interferon alpha. As far as we know, this is the first report in English literature indicating such an adverse effect of pegylated interferon alpha.",0,0

Symptoms began during a course of IFN alpha, resolved with its suspension, and recurred on rechallenge. Restless legs syndrome may thus be an adverse effect of IFN alpha treatment.",2004,6
403,15203443,"Naltrexone: report of lack of hepatotoxicity in acute viral hepatitis, with a review of the literature.","Many clinicians appear to be concerned about the potential hepatotoxicity of the opiate antagonist naltrexone (NTX) and this may be one reason why it is not used more widely in treating both heroin and alcohol abusers. Some much-quoted early studies noted abnormalities in liver function tests (LFTs) in very obese patients taking high doses, although there was no evidence of clinically significant liver dysfunction. These concerns may be reinforced by advice in the UK product information sheet to perform LFTs before and during treatment, by high infection rates with hepatitis C virus (HCV) among injecting heroin addicts and by the frequency of abnormal LFTs in alcohol abusers. We describe a heroin abuser in whom clinical and laboratory manifestations of acute hepatitis B and C appeared a few days after the insertion of a subcutaneous naltrexone implant. A decision was made not to remove the implant but the hepatitis resolved completely and uneventfully well within the normal time-scale. A review of the literature indicates that even when given at much higher doses than are needed for treating heroin or alcohol abusers, there is no evidence that NTX causes clinically significant liver disease or exacerbates, even at high doses, serious pre-existing liver disease. During the past decade, NTX has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of pruritus associated with severe jaundice caused by severe and sometimes life-threatening cirrhosis and other liver diseases. Its safety, even in these extreme conditions, is particularly reassuring. We suggest that it may be more appropriate and economical to advise patients to report promptly any suspected side effects than to perform regular LFTs, which may be misleading.",2004,3
404,15224368,Sweet's syndrome associated with sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) treatment.,"Sweet's syndrome is an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis that is a known complication of the administration of filgrastim, a drug that causes increased neutrophil proliferation and differentiation. This complication has not previously been reported during treatment with sargramostim, a hematopoietic cytokine with activity that overlaps filgrastim. We report a case of Sweet's syndrome in association with sargramostim treatment following chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia. A suspected second episode occurred after subsequent chemotherapy and sargramostim treatment. Physicians should be aware of this possible association because the signs and symptoms of Sweet's syndrome are easily mistaken as being due to infection.",2004,7
405,15235919,Sudden cardiac death due to hypersensitivity myocarditis during clozapine treatment.,"The case concerns the sudden death of a 29-year-old male during clozapine therapy started 2 weeks before. He had a history of treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia. A complete immunohistochemical study was performed on heart specimens. Histologically, the heart presented diffuse eosinophilic infiltrates located around perivascular structures and focal myocyte necrosis with numerous interstitial eosinophils admixed with histiocytes. The diagnosis of acute myocarditis with an eosinophilic infiltrate was established as the cause of death. The autopsy findings and a detailed medical history supported the conclusion that clozapine-induced hypersensitivity myocarditis was the most likely cause of death.",2004,10
406,15239684,Early histopathologic changes in purple glove syndrome.,"An 86-year-old African-American man presented with tonic-clonic seizures. Intravenous phenytoin was urgently administered into the dorsum of the right hand. The patient developed a raised purple area of discoloration around the intravenous insertion site within 2 h and edema and vesiculobullous lesions of the distal forearm, hands, and fingers within 8 h. Microscopic sections from a biopsy at 12 h revealed epidermal necrosis, superficial ulceration, and a mild superficial and deep perivascular lymphoid infiltrate, associated with numerous thrombi of small vessels throughout the dermis. The findings were judged to be consistent with soft-tissue injury associated with intravenous administration of phenytoin, also termed purple glove syndrome. Purple glove syndrome, named for its distinctive purple discoloration and swelling of the hands in the distribution of a glove, is an uncommon complication of intravenous phenytoin administration through small dorsal veins of the hands. It is comprised by pain, discoloration, and edema in the vicinity of intravenous infusion of phenytoin through dorsal veins of the hand. The histopathologic features of fully developed lesions have been reported; however, early-stage findings have not been previously described, and the histogenesis of this lesion is controversial. The presence of thrombi in this early-stage lesion suggests that thrombosis plays a role in the initial pathogenesis of this condition.",2004,8
407,15261876,Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation results in reversal of alopecia in Parkinson's disease.,"Alopecia is a rare but important side effect of anti-parkinsonian medications. Our patient was a 72-year-old man with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) who received levodopa and anti-cholinergic drugs and whose head had become almost completely bald. As bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation produced improvement in his motor symptoms, his drug dosages were reduced postoperatively. At 8 months after surgery, hair again covered his entire head. Our study presents a new aspect of the benefit of STN stimulation with regard to drug-induced non-motor symptoms in patient with PD.",2004,8

A patient with monocular open-angle glaucoma had trichiasis, a condition associated with the use of a prostaglandin analog. The patient was treated with radiofrequency cautery and is now asymptomatic. The unmedicated eye remains asymptomatic to date. Increased lash length, thickness, and pigmentation are well-documented side effects of prostaglandin analog glaucoma drops.

409,15286697,"Fatal pulmonary fibrosis associated with BCNU: the relative role of platelet-derived growth factor-B, insulin-like growth factor I, transforming growth factor-beta1 and cyclooxygenase-2.","Pulmonary fibrosis is a severe complication associated with bis-chloronitrosourea (BCNU) therapy. However, the pathogenetic mechanism has never been well investigated. We report here a 26-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who died of severe pulmonary fibrosis 81 days after the administration of high-dose BCNU (600 mg/m2). Thoracoscopic wedge resection of left upper lung performed 10 days before patient's death showed severe pulmonary fibrosis with prominent hyperplasia of alveolar macrophages and type II pneumocytes. We further used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to examine the relative role of platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the pathogenesis of BCNU-related pulmonary fibrosis. Strong expressions of PDGF-B and IGF-1 on alveolar macrophages and type II pneumocytes were clearly demonstrated, but in contrast, the expressions of TGF-beta1 and COX-2 were almost undetectable. In conclusion, pulmonary fibrosis can develop early and progress rapidly after the administration of high-dose BCNU. The markedly increased expression of fibrogenic factors PDGF-B and IGF-1 on hyperplastic alveolar macrophages and hyperplastic type II pneumocytes may play an important role in the fibrogenesis of this disease. These novel findings may offer specific therapeutic targets in the treatment of BCNU-associated pulmonary fibrosis.",2004,10
410,15289139,Dorzolamide-induced choroidal detachment in a surgically untreated eye.,"Choroidal detachment is a known complication of topical hypotensive agents when used to treat eyes sensitized by prior surgery. We document the abrupt development of an extensive choroidal detachment after initiation of dorzolamide therapy in a surgically untreated eye with primary open-angle glaucoma.
Observational case report.
A 76-year-old woman with primary open-angle glaucoma and no history of ocular surgery developed a choroidal detachment 12 hours after initiation of therapy with dorzolamide eye drops. Choroidal detachment was diagnosed clinically and confirmed by echography.
Withdrawal of the drug and initiation of corticosteroid drops resulted in prompt resolution of the choroidal detachment.
Choroidal detachment can occur in surgically untreated eyes after use of a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.",2004,8
411,15300114,Deepening of lid sulcus from topical bimatoprost therapy.,"To report a new adverse effect related to treatment with bimatoprost.
Serial clinical examination of three patients was performed. In each of the three reported patients, alteration of eyelid appearance with deepening of the lid sulcus was evident as the result of topical bimatoprost therapy.
A comprehensive literature search of Medline using WebMd and MDConsult, was conducted to cross reference known side effects of topical prostaglandin analog treatment. The keywords utilized were prostaglandin analogs, prostaglandins, prostamide, glaucoma, ocular hypertension, intraocular pressure, side effects, adverse effects, bimatoprost, latanoprost, lumigan, and xalatan. This appears to be the first such report in the literature. Clinicians and patients should be made aware of this possible complication of topical bimatoprost therapy.",2004,8
412,15304176,Lichen planus induced by hepatitis B vaccination: a new case and review of the literature.,"In May 1996, as part of his routine antihepatitis B (hepB) vaccination plan, a 28-year-old HbsAg-negative man, hospital worker, received his first dose (20 microg) of a recombinant vaccine (EngerixB-B, Smith Kline and Beecham, Belgium), administered via deltoid injection. The patient was otherwise healthy and taking no medication. Thirty days after the 2nd booster dose, several pruritic, polygonal, purple, papules appeared on the volar aspect of the patient's wrists. New lesions gradually spread to the arms and trunk (Fig. 1). The clinical diagnosis of lichen planus (LP) was confirmed by histology, which revealed hyperorthokeratosis, hypergranulosis, vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer cells and a dense, band-like lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis. The disease started to heal after treatment with topical clobetasol propionate 0.05% and sun exposure during the following summer. Five days after the 3rd booster dose, in November 1996, the dermatosis relapsed on the forearms, trunk, and legs. On that occasion, routine laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, blood chemistry and liver function tests, were within normal limits. Screening serologic tests for autoantibodies including antinuclear antibodies, antidouble-stranded DNA, anti-SS-A, anti-SS-B and anti-Sm were all negative. As a result of the inadequate levels of antihepatitis B antibodies, less than 10 IU/l in May 1998, in a high-risk patient who was frequently exposed to blood and its products, an additional booster dose was performed. Three days later a new recurrence of disseminated lichen planus occurred. The patient was successfully treated with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. There was no recurrence the following year.",2004,8

In patient 1 with massive pulmonary thromboembolism, transesophageal ultrasound revealed large right atrial thrombus entrapped in a patent foramen ovale. Initial treatment with heparin was substituted with thrombolysis, which resulted in clinical improvement and dissolution of right heart thrombus but was followed by fatal intracerebral haemorrhage. In patient 2, thrombolysis caused mobilisation of thrombotic mass as evidenced by disappearance of thrombus on ultrasound. Massive pulmonary thromboembolism resulted in circulatory collapse. Short cardiopulmonary resuscitation restored spontaneous circulation and the patient recovered completely.",2004,6

This proved to be extensive forearm deep venous thrombosis. The site of thrombosis and the chronological relationship with the IIR implicates a hypersensitivity to infliximab in the causation of the venous thrombosis in this case. With an increasing trend towards re-treating patients with known IIRs, clinicians should be aware of this potentially serious and previously unreported complication.",2004,9
416,15331204,Possible induction of diabetes by treatment of hypertension with indapamide (with four case reports).,"To study therapy with indapamide impairing carbohydrate metabolism in essential hypertension patients and achieve earlier prevention, diagnoses and treatment of diabetes induced by indapamide.
Four cases of essential hypertension patients (1 male and 3 females) were observed through process of therapy with indapamide and laboratory investigations.
After 4- to 14-month period of therapy with the combination of indapamide (2.5 mg/day) and fosinopril (10 mg/day) in three patients and 6-month period of monotherapy with indapamide (2.5 mg/day) in one patient, glucose levels of all patients increased and achieve criteria of diabetes diagnoses. After 3- to 13-month period of therapy without indapamide, glucose levels of all patients decreased and diabetes disappeared.
Therapy with indapamide may induce diabetes in essential hypertension patients. After stopping indapamide, glucose tolerance impairing may be reversed.",2004,9
417,15338554,Progression of chronic myeloid leukemia to blast crisis during treatment with imatinib mesylate.,"Previous investigators have reported discrepancies between hematologic, marrow morphologic, and cytogenetic responses to imatinib mesylate among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In addition to disease refractoriness, rare instances of disease progression from chronic phase to blast crisis during imatinib therapy have recently been anecdotally reported.
To describe the clinicopathologic features of 3 patients with CML who rapidly progressed from chronic phase to blast crisis while taking imatinib and to perform a review of the literature.
Morphologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic analyses were performed on the 3 patients at the time of initial diagnosis, during imatinib therapy, and at blast crisis.
The 3 patients were men, aged 39, 42, and 43 years. Two had been treated with hydroxyurea for 16 and 21 months before imatinib therapy, while 1 was started on a regimen of imatinib following diagnosis. Despite a hematologic response in all 3 patients, none of them achieved cytogenetic remission, and all progressed to blast crisis at 7 to 10 months of imatinib therapy. Blood findings during blast transformation were heterogeneous, including normal blood morphologic findings in 1 patient, leukocytosis with circulating blasts and basophilia in 1, and marked pancytopenia in 1. All 3 marrow specimens demonstrated moderate to marked diffuse reticulin fibrosis with more than 20% blasts. Clonal cytogenetic evolution was evident in 2 of the 3 patients and included an extra Philadelphia chromosome in both. All 3 patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. One was alive with no evidence of disease at 14 month follow-up, while 2 had residual disease after bone marrow transplantation and died of complications at 4 and 5 months after transplantation.
Blood data did not always reflect marrow status. Therefore, bone marrow follow-up is critical for monitoring of response. Our findings suggest that significant progression of marrow reticulin fibrosis during imatinib therapy can be an indicator for a return or progression of CML and, in some patients with CML, imatinib may promote cytogenetic clonal evolution, resulting in a poor response to treatment.",2004,9

There are few reports in the literature of hypoglycemia with concurrent administration of an oral hyperglycemic agent and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. We present a case of a diabetic patient taking glyburide who was prescribed ciprofloxacin and developed prolonged hypoglycemia, which persisted for over 24 hours. The mechanisms by which these agents interact to produce prolonged hypoglycemia are complex and probably multifactorial. Patients stabilized on glyburide who are started on a fluoroquinolone should have their glucose levels monitored closely.",2004,0

Pancreatitis has been noted to be a complication in 2-16% of patients undergoing treatment with L-asparaginase for a variety of pediatric neoplasms. Most cases of pancreatitis associated with L-asparaginase toxicity are self-limiting and respond favorably to nasogastric decompression and intravenous hyperalimentation. However, in rare instances, hemorrhagic pancreatitis or necrosis may occur. L-asparaginase-induced pancreatitis is an uncommon but potential lethal complication of the treatment of leukemia.

423,15388215,Intentional overdose with tiagabine: an unusual clinical presentation.,"Tiagabine (Gabitril) is a unique anticonvulsant that is prescribed for a variety of psychiatric disorders. We report a case of intentional self-poisoning with tiagabine. A 46-year-old woman was brought to the Emergency Department after being found confused and nonverbal while wandering in a field. Eighteen tablets (72 mg) of her tiagabine prescription were missing. Remarkable findings on initial examination were facial grimacing, flexure posturing of both upper extremities, and 7-mm, reactive pupils. She was uncommunicative and unable to follow commands. Vital signs, blood chemistries and a head CT scan were normal. Urine toxicology screening was negative. An extrapyramidal reaction was suspected and diphenhydramine 50 mg was administered without effect. Lorazepam 2 mg was given with significant improvement. She was admitted for observation and all symptoms resolved within 12 h of admission. Tiagabine overdose causes an unusual array of neurological symptoms, many similar to reported adverse effects during therapeutic use.",2004,10

In this report, two newborns with congenital heart anomalies demonstrated the harlequin color change, one whose skin findings showed a course related to the dose of systemic prostaglandin E1, suggesting a possible association. The benign, self-limited nature of the color change mandates that prostaglandin E1 not be discontinued for this reason. The entity is likely more common than the paucity of reports in the world literature suggests, and all physicians should recognize its graphic appearance to avoid unnecessary exposure to agents in an effort to treat it.",0,0

429,15482394,Unusual hypersensitivity to warfarin in a critically ill patient.,"A patient was admitted to the intensive care unit because of respiratory failure, and warfarin therapy was started at 2 mg/day for the treatment of pulmonary embolism, together with other medications. Despite the low dosage of warfarin, international normalized ratio (INR) was markedly elevated from 1.15 to 11.28 for only 4 days, and bleeding symptoms concurrently developed. Vitamin K2 was infused along with discontinuation of warfarin. One day later, the INR was found to have decreased, and bleeding was also improved. An objective causality assessment indicated a probable relationship between clotting abnormality and warfarin administration, although the degree of elevation of the INR was unusual in the light of the daily warfarin dose and duration of its exposure. Based on the clinical status of the patient, it was suspected that several conditions contributed to the abnormal hypersensitivity to warfarin. Contributory factors probably included pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administrated drugs, vitamin K deficiency caused by decreased dietary intake, reduced gut bacterial production, impaired intestinal absorption and hepatic synthetic capacity, and increased consumption of clotting factors. In view of our experience in the present case, it should be stressed that close monitoring of coagulation capacity is necessary in critically ill patients in order to avoid fatal haemorrhage after initiating warfarin therapy regardless of the dosage.",2004,10
430,15489872,Use of leflunomide in an allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient with refractory cytomegalovirus infection.,"Ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is an emerging problem in transplant recipients. Foscarnet resistance and cidofovir resistance have also been described, but no previous reports have suggested treatment regimens for patients with CMV refractory to all three of these drugs. Leflunomide, an immunosuppressive drug used in rheumatoid arthritis and in rejection in solid-organ transplantation, has been reported to have novel anti-CMV activity. However, its clinical utility in CMV treatment has not been described previously. We report an allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient who developed CMV infection refractory to sequential therapy with ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. The patient was ultimately treated with a combination of leflunomide and foscarnet. Both phenotypic and genotypic virologic analysis was performed on sequential CMV isolates. The patient's high CMV-DNA viral load became undetectable on leflunomide and foscarnet, but the patient, who had severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the liver, expired with progressive liver failure and other complications. We concluded that leflunomide is a new immunosuppressive agent with anti-CMV activity, which may be useful in the treatment of multiresistant CMV. However, the toxicity profile of leflunomide in patients with underlying GVHD remains to be defined.",2004,12
431,15494638,Peripheral neuropathy associated with capecitabine.,"5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-associated peripheral neuropathy is an uncommon event. Capecitabine (CAP) is a pro-drug of 5-FU and peripheral neuropathy associated with CAP has not been reported. During analysis of 28 patients receiving CAP with concomitant radiation (XRT) for pancreatic cancer (resected or locally advanced), two patients developed signs and symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy. Patients received CAP 1200-1600 mg/m2 in two divided doses with XRT (total 5040-5400 Gy) x 6 weeks, followed by 4 weeks rest, then 6 cycles of CAP 2000-2500 mg/m2 in two divided doses x 14 days every (q) 3 weeks. Patients were assessed weekly during CAP-XRT and q 3 weeks during CAP alone. Patient A reported right leg weakness (foot drop) during week 4 of CAP-XRT (1600 mg/m2). Patient B developed perioral and upper extremity paresthesias during the fourth cycle of CAP alone (2500 mg/m2). Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity was measured by radioisotopic assay using lysates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Neurologic examination revealed right foot drop in Patient A and was unremarkable in Patient B. Central nervous system imaging was negative. Electromyogram and nerve conduction studies showed sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy in both patients. DPD activity was normal in both patients. There was no evidence of disease progression. Neurologic symptoms resolved after stopping CAP for 4 weeks in Patient A, with no recurrence after reinitiating CAP alone at 2000 mg/m2. Patient B continued at 80% of standard dose (2000 mg/m2) and symptoms resolved without further intervention. We conclude peripheral neuropathy with 5-FU is rare. Neurotoxicity occurs most often with intermittent high dose 5-FU as bolus injection or 24- to 48-h infusions. The etiology of neurotoxicity in our two patients remains unclear; however, as CAP is rapidly metabolized to 5-FU in patients with normal liver function, it is likely that 5-FU or its active metabolites (fluoro-beta-alanine) were contributing factors. Knowledge regarding potential adverse effects of CAP is paramount and dose modification is indicated with development of neurotoxicity.",2004,9
432,15504988,Severe hypo-alpha-lipoproteinemia during treatment with rosiglitazone.,"Thiazolidinedione drugs are in widespread use for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In addition to improving insulin sensitivity, they generally result in a modest elevation of plasma HDL cholesterol. We report three patients, all of whom had preexisting diabetic dyslipidemia, who showed a profound reduction in plasma HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI levels soon after the initiation of rosiglitazone therapy. In all three patients, HDL cholesterol levels returned to normal following drug withdrawal. The fact that this phenomenon was not seen in >1,400 patients studied in clinical trials indicates that it is likely to be rare and idiosyncratic. Until the frequency of this adverse reaction is clearer, it would seem advisable to ensure that plasma HDL cholesterol is documented before and rechecked after commencement of thiazolidinedione therapy.",2004,11

434,15516308,Fatal overdoses associated with quetiapine.,"Quetiapine (Seroquel) is an atypical antipsychotic drug belonging to a new chemical class, the benzothiazepine derivatives. We present three cases from the Provincial Toxicology Center of British Columbia, Canada in which suicidal overdose deaths were associated with quetiapine. The blood specimens were initially subjected to a thorough qualitative analysis. Basic drugs were screened for by liquid-liquid extraction followed by gas chromatography-nitrogen-phosphorus (GC-NPD) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-electron impact detection utilizing both in-house and commercial search libraries. Acidic and neutral drugs were screened for by liquid-liquid extraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection. Volatiles were assayed by gas chromatography-flame-ionization detection. Quetiapine was assayed in biological specimens by basic extraction with n-butyl chloride and derivatized with 50 microL of MTBSTFA and separation by GC-NPD. Linearity was observed up to 2.0 mg/L. Samples with concentrations exceeding the linearity were diluted. These cases were chosen for study because they were all deaths as a result of suicidal ingestion of drugs in which quetiapine was considered a significant factor. The concentrations of quetiapine in these cases are 6-16 times greater than the upper reported therapeutic range (0.1-1.0 mg/L). In case #1, the concentrations of quetiapine found were 7.20 mg/L (19 micromol/L) in blood and 0.93 mg/L (2.4 micromol/L) in vitreous fluid. In case #2, the concentrations of quetiapine found were 16 mg/L in blood (42 micromol/L), 120 mg/kg (310 micromol/kg) in liver, and 1.8 mg/L (4.6 micromol/L) in vitreous fluid. In case #3, the concentrations of quetiapine found in femoral blood was 5.90 mg/L (15 micromol/L). In all cases, drugs in addition to quetiapine were detected, but in cases #1 and #2, the cause of death was considered to be a quetiapine overdose and the other drugs were not considered to be contributory. Case #3 was considered a mixed drug overdose.",2004,9
435,15522120,Itch and skin rash from chocolate during fluoxetine and sertraline treatment: case report.,"The skin contains a system for producing serotonin as well as serotonin receptors. Serotonin can also cause pruritus when injected into the skin. SSRI-drugs increase serotonin concentrations and are known to have pruritus and other dermal side effects.
A 46-year-old man consulted his doctor due to symptoms of depression. He did not suffer from any allergy but drinking red wine caused vasomotor rhinitis. Antidepressive treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg daily was initiated which was successful. After three weeks of treatment an itching rash appeared. An adverse drug reaction (ADR) induced by fluoxetine was suspected and fluoxetine treatment was discontinued. The symptoms disappeared with clemastine and betametasone treatment. Since the depressive symptoms returned sertraline medication was initiated. After approximately two weeks of sertraline treatment he noted an intense itching sensation in his scalp after eating a piece of chocolate cake. The itch spread to the arms, abdomen and legs and the patient treated himself with clemastine and the itch disappeared. He now realised that he had eaten a chocolate cake before this episode and remembered that before the first episode he had had a chocolate mousse dessert. He had never had any reaction from eating chocolate before and therefore reported this observation to his doctor.
This case report suggests that there may be individuals that are very sensitive to increases in serotonin concentrations. Dermal side reactions to SSRI-drugs in these patients may be due to high activity in the serotonergic system at the dermal and epidermo-dermal junctional area rather than a hypersensitivity to the drug molecule itself.",2004,11

437,15533031,Paradoxical cerebral cortical hyperexcitability following flupirtine overdose.,"We report the case of a patient with increased cerebral cortical excitability following intoxication with flupirtine, a centrally acting analgesic and antispastic drug. Typically, flupirtine exerts membrane stabilizing and hyperpolarizing effects through activation of neuronal G-protein regulated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRK). Based on these properties, GIRK activators have been suggested as candidates for antiepileptic drug development. In contrast, our observation suggests that these substances may also display unexpected proconvulsant effects in vivo.",2004,0

Most current guidelines for the management of anaphylaxis list only epinephrine as a vasopressor to use in the event of cardiovascular collapse. We present two cases of anaphylaxis under anaesthesia where return of spontaneous circulation was refractory to epinephrine, but occurred following the administration of the alpha-agonist metaraminol. Potential advantages and disadvantages of using epinephrine in this setting, the role of alpha-agonists and some potential mechanisms accounting for their role in successful management are reviewed.",2004,12
440,15554737,Localized panniculitis and subsequent lipoatrophy with subcutaneous glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) injection for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.,"Glatiramer acetate (copolymer 1, Copaxone) is a mixture of synthetic polypeptides and is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to possess beneficial effects in reducing the relapse rate in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Its main mechanism of action is regarded as a switch of the immune reaction from a T helper (Th)1 to a Th2 cell type. Glatiramer acetate is administered by subcutaneous injection once daily. As described in previous reports, the most common adverse effects are pain, inflammation, and induration at the injection site, occurring in approximately 20-60% of patients. A rare adverse effect is a localized lipoatrophy at the site of injection, which has previously been observed and described in 11 patients. It has been reported that these atrophic areas remain unchanged and localized lipoatrophy may be preceded by a subcutaneous panniculitis. In this article, we describe another case of subcutaneous changes following repeated glatiramer acetate injection, presented as localized panniculitis in the area around the injection sites, in a 46-year-old female patient who was treated with glatiramer acetate for 18 months.",2004,0

These children aged 2.5-15 years were treated for Burkitt's lymphoma, Ewing's tumour, small cell bone tumour or medulloblastoma. PVT was diagnosed on colour Doppler ultrasonography (US). In four patients, thrombosis occurred 2-45 days after severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD) secondary to intensive chemotherapy containing busulfan. In one case, PVT occurred in the absence of HVOD in a patient with pre-existing periportal lymphomatous infiltration. Four patients experienced persistent portal hypertension, which resulted in death in one. PVT during chemotherapy in children is a rare event and appears to be closely related to intensive chemotherapy containing busulfan and to be associated with HVOD.",2004,12

Here, we describe a case of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease occurring 4 months after the start of interferon alpha treatment, probably induced by the immunomodulatory effects of interferon. Therefore, we conclude that chronic hepatitis C patients, especially people with darkly pigmented skin, need to be closely monitored for ophthalmologic complications, by periodic check-up of the optic fundi, for a prolonged period, during interferon treatment.",2004,11
444,15588385,Successful treatment of hyperthyroidism with amiodarone in a patient with propylthiouracil-induced acute hepatic failure.,"Acute hepatic failure is a rare and potentially lethal complication of propylthiouracil (PTU) use for hyperthyroidism. We present a 20-year-old woman with Basedow-Graves' disease who developed PTU-induced fulminant hepatitis, which progressed to acute hepatic failure with grade III hepatic encephalopathy. Laboratory evaluation ruled out the most common causes of fulminant hepatitis. We treated her hyperthyroidism with amiodarone (average daily dose, 200 mg) for 3 weeks, achieving rapid and persistent euthyroidism, (triiodothyronine [T(3)] levels ranged between 64 and 109 ng/dL) without side effects. Amiodarone treatment did not abolish the thyroid radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU), allowing for subsequent treatment with radioactive iodine. The clinical course was favorable and the patient achieved full hepatic recovery 3 months after the hepatic failure was detected. After an extensive review of the literature, we believe that this is the first communication of the successful use of amiodarone to control hyperthyroidism in a patient with PTU-induced fulminant hepatitis.",2004,10
445,15595320,Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorder in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and rofecoxib: idiosyncratic reaction or pharmacogenetics?,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease associated with altered immunoregulation and resulting in a deforming polyarthritis. Methotrexate (MTX) is a commonly used second line agent for RA, and there have been several recent reports of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated polyclonal B cell lymphoproliferative disorder in MTX-treated RA patients. The patient in this report had long standing RA treated with MTX and had recently begun taking a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor. She developed a febrile illness associated with severe pancytopenia and leukocytoclastic vasculitic rash followed by diffuse adenopathy, with serologic and pathologic evidence of EBV infection. Previous studies have demonstrated the interaction of MTX and a variety of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with various clinical manifestations including acute renal failure, pancytopenia, vomiting, diarrhea, elevated liver transaminases, jaundice, mucosal ulcerations, and pyrexia. However, we have not identified previous reports suggesting interaction between MTX and COX-2 inhibitors. We hypothesize that decreased renal elimination of MTX induced by the COX-2 inhibitor resulted in enhanced hematopoietic toxicity and immunosuppression causing the EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease.",2002,12
446,15611427,Psoriasis triggered by toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod in the presence of dermal plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors.,"It has been proposed that the innate immune system plays a central role in driving the autoimmune T-cell cascade leading to psoriasis; however, there is no direct evidence for this.
We observed aggravation and spreading of a psoriatic plaque when treated topically with the toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 agonist imiquimod. The exacerbation of psoriasis was accompanied by a massive induction of lesional type I interferon activity, detected by MxA expression after imiquimod therapy. Since imiquimod induces large amounts of type I interferon production from TLR7-expressing plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors (PDCs), the natural interferon-producing cells of the peripheral blood, we asked whether PDCs are present in psoriatic skin. We identified high numbers of PDCs in psoriatic skin lesions (up to 16% of the total dermal infiltrate) based on their coexpression of BDCA2 and CD123. By contrast, PDCs were present at very low levels in atopic dermatitis and not detected in normal human skin.
This study shows that psoriasis can be driven by the innate immune system through TLR ligation. Furthermore, our finding that large numbers of PDCs infiltrate psoriatic skin suggests a role of lesional PDCs as type I interferon-producing targets for the TLR7 agonist imiquimod.",2004,12
447,15623719,Progressive outer retinal necrosis presenting with isolated optic neuropathy.,"Progressive outer retinal necrosis is a necrotizing herpetic retinopathy usually seen in immunocompromised patients. The authors describe two patients with this disease who initially had findings suggestive of an optic neuropathy. Vision declined after treatment with methylprednisolone, after which fundus examination became consistent with progressive outer retinal necrosis. These cases underscore the importance of careful examination of the retinal periphery before management of any presumed optic neuropathy with steroids.",2004,12
448,15628319,Drug eruption caused by azathioprine: value of using the drug-induced lymphocytes stimulation test for diagnosis.,"Azathioprine (AZA) is an immunosuppressant commonly used for organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases. Allergic side effects of AZA are rare, and reported allergic skin eruptions from AZA are very limited in Japan. We report AZA-induced drug eruption that developed in two cases of systemic scleroderma with polymyositis. One case presented with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and the other had systemic papular erythema. The stimulation indices of the drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) for AZA in these two patients were as high as 2,180% and 430%, respectively, but those of healthy volunteers were under 120% without nonspecific suppression of lymphocyte proliferation. Other drugs used simultaneously were ruled out by patch and challenge tests. The challenge test for Stevens-Johnson syndrome type drug allergy is very risky. DLST is a good diagnostic tool for AZA allergy, especially for severe drug allergy cases.",2004,9
449,15644988,Tardive dyskinesia in 2 patients treated with ziprasidone.,"Ziprasidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug that is believed to have a low propensity for inducing extrapyramidal symptoms, including tardive dyskinesia (TD). Two of our patients developed TD after 23 months and 34 months of ziprasidone monotherapy, respectively. One of the patients had had earlier exposure to typical antipsychotic drugs, but no other predisposing factors for TD were noted. Therefore, patients on long-term therapy with atypical antipsychotic drugs should be screened periodically for TD.",2004,11
450,15661067,Asthenozoospermia: possible association with long-term exposure to an anti-epileptic drug of carbamazepine.,"Little attention has been paid to infertility in men with epilepsy and little information exists about the mechanisms by which anti-epileptic drugs affect spermatogenesis or sperm function. We report a case of a male infertility patient with asthenozoospermia during long-term treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. A 29-year-old man had continued treatment with anti-epileptic drugs under the diagnosis of epilepsy for 13 years. He and his wife had been examined and treated as an infertile couple for 3 years. The patient was found to have no motile sperm with a normal sperm count, while taking a dose of 400 mg/day of carbamazepine. On suspicion of an adverse effect of carbamazepine, he was switched to phenytoin monotherapy. One month after that, sperm motility was vastly improved (65%) and they conceived a child 5 months after that. One must be cautious in extrapolating from a case report, but these findings strongly suggest a direct effect of carbamazepine on spermatic function.",2005,1
451,15663666,Scrotal ulceration induced by all-trans retinoic acid in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia.,"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been shown to improve the outcome in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia compared with chemotherapy alone, but it is associated with adverse effects. We report the development of scrotal ulcer in a patient with acute promyleocytic leukemia (APL) within 10 days of treatment with ATRA at a dose of 40 mg orally twice daily. The ulcer did not respond to antibiotic treatment and healed shortly after withholding ATRA. The biopsy showed inflammation only, and other microbiological workup was negative.",2005,1
452,15671134,A case of clozapine-induced tonic-clonic seizures managed with valproate: implications for clinical care.,"We describe a case of clozapine-induced seizures in a patient with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. She had previously been treated unsuccessfully with a number of atypical antipsychotic medications, before she was eventually started on clozapine. She experienced two separate episodes of observed fits whilst on an initial daily dose of 125 mg and, subsequently, on a daily dose of 237.5 mg. Following discontinuation of clozapine, she was rechallenged and again was observed to have seizures. Appropriate investigations ruled out any organic cause of the fits and clozapine was successfully restarted, together with sodium valproate. By the time of treatment stabilization, the patient had not experienced any further fits. These findings suggest that clozapine-induced seizures can be successfully treated, that gradual dose titration can reduce the likelihood of further episodes of seizures and that concomitant use of a suitable mood stabilizer/anti-epileptic medication can improve the outcome of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Furthermore, the concomitant use of fluoxetine and clozapine is discouraged, with citalopram suggested as a suitable antidepressant in those depressed patients receiving clozapine.",2005,1

Case reports and associated biopsy findings.
Three patients who developed symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during rofecoxib exposure are described along with pathology findings. Two episodes were incident cases (no prior IBD); one episode was recurrent colitis or a nonincident case (flare of prior IBD). All symptoms resolved with drug withdrawal.
Symptoms and pathologic changes of colitis are associated with exposure to rofecoxib. Abnormalities resolve with drug withdrawal.",2005,2
454,15685264,Carbamazepine toxicity following Oxybutynin and Dantrolene administration: a case report.,"To report a case of Carbamazepine toxicity following the administration of Oxybutynin and Dantrolene.
A case report.
The Spinal Rehabilitation Department, Loewenstein Hospital, Raanana, Israel.
A patient with C6D tetraplegia who sustained intoxication because of drug interaction is presented. She had been treated by Carbamazepine 1000 mg/day for neuropathic pain for 2 years without clinical or laboratory signs of toxicity. After administration of Oxybutynin concomitantly with an increase in the dose of Dantrolene, she presented the clinical symptoms and laboratory finding of Carbamazepine intoxication. Trying to adjust the treatment to the patient's requirements, Carbamazepine together with Oxybutynin and Dantrolene was readministrated in lower doses.
The combination of these drugs, even small doses, caused toxicity. Adding Dantrolene and Oxybutynin elevated the blood level of Carbamazepine, possibly by inhibition of cytochrome P450.
A possible pharmacokinetic interaction between Dantrolene and Oxybutynin should be borne in mind when considering Carbamazepine medication for a patient with a spinal cord lesion.",2005,4
455,1569260,Drug-induced pemphigus related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.,"We report a case of drug-induced pemphigus caused by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. The cutaneous reaction remitted after withdrawal of captopril therapy. Unique to this case, however, was the substitution of another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, without exacerbation of the pemphigus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported patient with captopril-induced pemphigus in whom no new lesions developed after subsequent treatment with enalapril. A difference in chemical structure between these two drugs, particularly of a sulfur moiety, may help explain why the drug-induced disease did not recur.",1992,2
456,15694139,Thalidomide neuropathy in childhood.,"Thalidomide was withdrawn from world markets in 1961 following recognition of its teratogenic effects. More recently, however, thalidomide treatment has been reintroduced to adult and paediatric practice for a variety of dermatologic, immunologic, rheumatologic and neoplastic disorders. Neuropathy is a significant side effect of thalidomide therapy, which may limit its clinical use. We report four cases of sensorimotor axonal neuropathy in children aged 10-15 years, treated with thalidomide for myxopapillary ependymoma, Crohn's disease and recurrent giant aphthous ulceration. Thalidomide neuropathy is often associated with proximal weakness and may progress even after discontinuation of treatment, in the phenomenon of 'coasting'. Children treated with thalidomide should undergo regular neurophysiologic studies in order to detect presymptomatic or progressive peripheral neuropathy.",2005,2
457,15701285,Cerebral edema associated with Gliadel wafers: two case studies.,"While the introduction of carmustine wafers (Gliadel wafers) into the tumor resection cavity has been shown to be a beneficial therapy for malignant glioma, it is recognized that clinically significant cerebral edema is a potential adverse effect. Following are two clinical case reports demonstrating profound cerebral edema associated with implantation of Gliadel wafers. As a result, one of these individuals had premature death. A brief literature review is provided to assist in explaining the mechanisms by which clinically significant cerebral edema may develop.",2005,1
458,15719254,Retinoic acid may increase the risk of bone marrow transplant nephropathy.,"Bone marrow transplant nephropathy (BMTN) classically presents more than 100 days after transplantation as an acute nephritis with hypertension, azotaemia and anemia that usually results in end stage renal failure (ESRF). The risk of developing BMTN may be greater with the use of more intensive chemotherapy and higher total body and tumor bed irradiation. Cis-retinoic acid (RA) may further increase the risk of developing BMTN. Here, we report the cases of two children who developed typical clinical and biochemical features of BMTN. They were both treated for stage IV neuroblastoma with chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant (BMT) conditioning that included total body irradiation and RA therapy after BMT, although the patient in case 1 had established renal insufficiency prior to the commencement of RA. Renal biopsy of these children showed classical BMTN histology, and the renal manifestations progressed quickly; the patient in case 1 became dialysis dependent by 1 year post-bone marrow transplant. Recently, RA has been added to the post-BMT therapy in children with stage IV neuroblastoma. The occurrence of BMTN in two children treated with RA in our unit is unlikely to be coincidental. Although RA has been shown to confer a significant survival advantage in this disease, animal studies and a previous case report have suggested it could increase the toxic effects of chemotherapy and renal irradiation. It is likely that RA contributed to the deterioration in renal function in these patients.",2005,4
459,15727358,Multiple superficial basal cell carcinomata--topical imiquimod versus curette and cryotherapy.,"Superficial basal cell carcinoma can be successfully managed by means other than surgical excision. Nonexcisional approaches include topical imiquimod, and curette and cryotherapy (C&C).
This article discusses the management of an insulin dependent diabetic man aged 52 years presenting with 17 torso basal cell carcinomas (BCCs); mostly superficial BCCs (SBCCs).
Half were treated with topical imiquimod. The remaining lesions were treated with curette and cryotherapy. All lesions resolved with proven histologic clearance. The patient considered C&C caused him less discomfort and disruption. He developed a late secondary infection in some sites treated with imiquimod. At 12 months there was no evidence of recurrence though new nodular BCCs and SBCCs had developed elsewhere on his upper torso. He has elected to have future SBCCs managed with C&C. While excisional surgery remains the benchmark management for nonmelanoma skin cancer, topical imiquimod and C&C are important options for treating SBCCs.",0,0
460,15729090,Quetiapine-induced myoclonus.,"We report a case of myoclonus induced by quetiapine. A 64-year-old man with schizophrenia developed myoclonic jerks when given higher doses of quetiapine. These movements were dose-related and completely abated on reducing the dose. To our knowledge, these movements have not been reported previously as an adverse effect of quetiapine.",2005,3
461,15735923,Treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome after temozolomide for recurrent high-grade glioma.,"In patients with recurrent malignant glioma, treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) and acute leukemia are rare adverse effects because the median survival after relapse is limited. We report a 44-year-old woman with t-MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts) following treatment of recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma with temozolomide (TMZ). A cytogenetic study showed del (3)(q11.1). MDS was diagnosed 8.4 months after beginning TMZ. The disease rapidly evolved into acute leukemia within 1 month after the onset of MDS, and the patient died 1 month later during induction chemotherapy. The prognosis of t-MDS is generally poor. Considering the increasing use of TMZ, which is regarded as a drug with moderate toxicity, careful follow-up with routine blood testing is vital.",2005,2
462,1575118,Antibiotic-associated neutropenia.,"Neutropenia is an uncommon but potentially serious complication of drug therapy. Many drugs, especially antibiotics, can produce this untoward effect. Typically, drug-induced neutropenia occurs in a patient receiving a semisynthetic penicillin for two weeks or more. The cause is believed to be either a hypersensitivity reaction or a toxic dose-related suppression of white blood cell precursors. Most patients improve after discontinuation of the drug.",1992,5
463,15752306,Livedo reticularis associated with interferon alpha therapy in two melanoma patients.,We report two patients who developed intense livedo reticularis clearly related to the administration of interferon alpha 2b as an adjuvant therapy for melanoma. Histological studies showed scattered perivascular infiltrates without vasculitis. Laboratory tests excluded any underlying condition. Resolution of the symptoms was observed in both patients when interferon alpha was withdrawn. These cases highlight the occurrence of livedo reticularis as an uncommon side-effect of interferon alpha treatment.,2005,3
464,15760792,Propylthiouracil-induced sensorineural hearing loss associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.,"To report the case of a young woman with Graves' disease in whom ototoxicity developed because of propylthiouracil (PTU)-induced antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis.
We present the clinical findings, pertinent laboratory data, and follow-up course of a patient with Graves' disease and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. We also provide a literature review regarding thionamide-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis.
In a 22-year-old Thai woman with Graves' disease, tinnitus, hearing impairment in the left ear (with progression to the right ear), and vertigo developed after 3 years of therapy with PTU. Audiograms showed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with cochlear lesions. She also had low-grade fever, intermittent chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, polyarthralgia, and conjunctivitis. An indirect immunofluorescence test for ANCA was positive. The hearing impairment and tinnitus were gradually reduced after PTU withdrawal and corticosteroid and azathioprine treatment. Definitive therapy by subtotal thyroidectomy was subsequently performed and yielded good results.
This rare case of PTU-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis manifested with ototoxicity in combination with systemic involvement.",0,0
465,15770343,Loss of vision and renal function in a patient with miliary tuberculosis.,"Visual loss is a rare complication of tuberculosis; it can be related to anti-tuberculous drugs or to the infection itself. For the treatment of visual loss, differential diagnosis is important between infection and adverse effect of anti-tuberculous drugs.
A 48-year-old male patient with a history of tuberculosis and visual loss during anti-tuberculous drug therapy was admitted to our hospital. Anti-tuberculous drugs had been stopped on the 2nd day of therapy due to development of optic neuritis secondary to ethambutol administration at another hospital. He had miliary tuberculosis, renal failure requiring dialysis and visual disturbances. Anti-tuberculous drugs, including ethambutol, were initiated at our clinic because the period between the ethambutol therapy and visual loss was too short and the dose of ethambutol was not very high. Computed brain tomography was normal. Fundoscopic examination revealed only hypertensive retinopathy. Our diagnosis was tuberculosis-related visual loss, which could be due to neuroretinitis, intraocular tuberculosis or chiasmal tuberculoma. In addition, ethambutol rarely causes visual loss during the early period or when given at lower doses. In our case no complications developed from the treatment and the patient's visual loss and renal function improved. At his last visit, 12 months later, his vision had improved and his serum creatinine was lower, at 2.2 mg/dL.
With anti-tuberculous treatment, renal functions and visual disturbances were improved in a patient with miliary tuberculosis. During the anti-tuberculous therapy, visual loss can be related to ethambutol toxicity or the tuberculosis infection itself. Differential diagnosis is very important and anti-tuberculous drugs must be continued if the diagnosis is tuberculosis.",2005,3
466,15773973,Flucloxacillin-induced aplastic anaemia and liver failure.,"Flucloxacillin is a commonly prescribed semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant penicillin primarily used for the treatment of cutaneous staphylococcal infections. It is well-recognized that flucloxacillin may occasionally result in fatal hepatic injury. We report the case of a 40-year-old woman who developed fulminant hepatic failure and aplastic anaemia following a course of oral flucloxacillin. At the time of transplantation the patient was severely neutropenic. Post-transplant, the patient received single donor leucocyte transfusions, which resulted in a dramatic increase in neutrophil count. The patient was discharged from hospital after 120 days with normal liver function and recovered bone marrow. In this report, we discuss the care of patients with aplastic anaemia in the peritransplant setting.",2005,4
467,15779196,Zoledronic acid-induced severe hypocalcaemia in a prostate cancer patient with extensive osteoblastic bone metastases.,"A 74-year old white man was undergoing treatment with palliative chemotherapy for Stage IV Prostate Adenocarcinoma with multiple osteoblastic metastases. He was started on intravenous Zoledronic acid for reduction of bone pain and prevention of skeletal complication from multiple bone metastases. Four days after intravenous Zoledronic acid, the patient presented to emergency room with complaints of carpopedal spasm and bronchospasm. On admission, serum calcium and albumin was 3.5 mg/dl and 3.7 g/dl respectively. QT interval was more than 500 m sec. The patient was started on intravenous calcium gluconate. He received 174 gm of intravenous calcium for total of 12 days. His serum calcium returned to a normal range in three months with Vitamin D and calcium supplement. Before starting Zoledronic acid therapy, the patient's serum calcium level was 6.9 mg/dl.",2005,2
468,1577957,Conditioning as an adjunct in the pharmacotherapy of lupus erythematosus.,"Several studies have provided evidence suggesting that ""placebo effects"" represent conditioning phenomena and that learning processes influence the response to placebo medication. This case report describes an adolescent with severe lupus erythematosus who received cyclophosphamide (CY) paired with taste (cod liver oil) and smell (rose perfume) as conditioned stimuli. The regimen was based on conditioning experiments with animals who had lupuslike autoimmune disease. After the initial pairings, the taste alone was offered between CY treatments. Over 12 months, the patient received six rather than 12 CY treatments, half the cumulative dose that might have been administered. The patient improved clinically, and 5 years later continues to do well.",1992,4
469,15785053,Mucosal pigmentation after oral lichen planus treatment with topical tacrolimus.,"Erosive oral lichen planus (OLP) is a painful chronic inflammatory disease that is sometimes resistant to systemic or topical therapies. Topical steroids remain the mainstay of therapy, but topical tacrolimus has recently been used to treat OLP resistant to topical corticosteroids. Topical tacrolimus appears as an effective and safe treatment of symptomatic OLP. We report the first histopathologically documented case of oral mucosa pigmentation after OLP treatment with topical tacrolimus. The relation between tacrolimus treatment and staining was suggested by the appearance of pigmentation during topical tacrolimus treatment and its clinical disappearance when treatment was stopped. Histopathology showed an increase in melanocyte numbers and melanogenesis.",2005,0
470,15790469,Primary ovarian large B-cell lymphoma in patient with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis treated with low dose Methotrexate.,"Primary ovarian lymphoma is an extremely rare disease and limited count reports about it have been reported in the literature. Traditionally, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have increased risk of nodal and extranodal lymphoid malignancies such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Recently, some studies have also reported association between patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) treated with Methotrexate (MTX) and malignant lymphoma developing.
We report a 17-year old JRA patient with primary ovarian diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The patient had seronegative (rheumatoid factor negative) poliarticular form of JRA and was receiving low dose weekly Methotrexate (MTX) during the past 2 years. Initial presentation was adnexial mass and chronic pelvic pain. The patient was treated with surgery and combined cytotoxic chemotherapy.
In conclusion, because of increased lymphoid malignancy risk, ovarian masses in JRA patients should be carefully evaluated.",2005,4
471,15795553,Risperidone withdrawal-related respiratory dyskinesia: a case diagnosed by spirography and fibroscopy.,"Risperidone is a frequently used member of a new class of atypical antipsychotics-the serotonin-dopamine antagonists (SDAs)-due to its comparatively high efficacy and low D2/5HT2 binding ratio, which results in a low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects including tardive dyskinesia (TD). The authors present an elderly patient with mixed dementia who developed TD at multiple sites, (including respiratory dyskinesia [RD], limb dyskinesia, and orofacial dyskinesia) following abrupt withdrawal of risperidone therapy. RD is not a rare condition, but is often misdiagnosed and is potentially lethal. Therefore, clinicians should pay close attention to possible onset of RD in patients with multiple risk factors for TD, even when SDA therapy is used. If RD is suspected, assessment should include spirography combined with fibroscopy for examination of irregularities in the rate, rhythm, and depth of respiration.",0,0
472,15806568,Visual system side effects caused by parasympathetic dysfunction after botulinum toxin type B injections.,"Botulinum toxin type B (BTX-B) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cervical dystonia. However, as with botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) it has off-label uses, such as for hyperhidrosis, focal dystonias, spasticity, and facial wrinkles. BTX-B has also been shown to be a safe and effective alternative for patients who are resistant to BTX-A. The most commonly reported side effects include dry mouth and dysphagia. To date, there have been few reports of visual disturbances associated with BTX-B use. In this study, we report on three individual patients who received BTX-B and who subsequently developed parasympathetic dysfunction of the visual system after injections of BTX-B at remote sites.",2005,7
473,1580986,Enalapril-induced anemia in two kidney transplant recipients.,"Two renal transplant patients developed anemia during treatment of hypertension with enalapril medication. Hemoglobin levels normalized after administration of enalapril was stopped. In one patient, it was demonstrated that the discontinuation of enalapril was followed by a decrease in renal blood flow and a significant increase in the plasma erythropoietin levels that preceded the rise in hemoglobin. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may cause anemia by increasing renal blood flow and consequently decreasing erythropoietin levels.",1992,3
474,15811174,Clearance rates of cerivastatin metabolites in a patient with cerivastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis.,"We report on a patient who developed acute rhabdomyolysis after taking cerivastatin. A 74-year-old hypercholestrerolaemic woman taking cerivastatin (0.15 mg/day) for 22 days complained of general muscle weakness and muscle pain. Her serum creatinine phosphokinase level was 19,190 IU/L. Serum myoglobin was over 3000 ng/mL. Serum concentration of cerivastatin at 6 h after taking the last dose (0.15 mg) was 8062.5 ng/L, which was almost 5.7 times higher than that of normal persons. The serum concentration of cerivastatin showed that the half-life of cerivastatin in this patient was 22.4 h, compared with 2.4 h for normal controls. Cerivastatin is catabolized by cytochrome P450, 3A4 and 2C8 to M-1, and by 2C8 to M-23. The ratio of M-23 to M-1 in her serum was much lower than that of control persons (0.64 vs. 2.08). She had previously taken simvastatin which is metabolized by CYP3A4, without any sign and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis. These results suggest that the slowed clearance of cerivastatin in this patient might have been compounded by cytochrome P450, 2C8 dysfunction.",2005,4
475,15823103,Carboplatin hypersensitivity induced by low-dose paclitaxel/carboplatin in multiple platinum-treated patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.,"We report five cases of carboplatin (CBDCA) hypersensitivity after weekly low-dose paclitaxel (60 mg/m2)/CBDCA (area under the concentration curve = 2) therapy in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer receiving multiple platinum-based chemotherapy. Paclitaxel and CBDCA therapy was indicated as second-line chemotherapy in one patient and as third line in four patients with recurrent disease. The range of previously administered total CBDCA was 2582-9589 mg, and the CBDCA area under the concentration curve of the first treatment exhibited appropriate intensity (mean, 1.92 +/- 0.10; range, 1.76-2.10) in all patients. However, one patient exhibited severe hypersensitivity reactions including cardiac arrest and apnea, and another four patients developed eruptions, hypotension, and tachycardia soon after administration of CBDCA. Our report suggested that CBDCA hypersensitivity was correlated with the total dose of previously administered platinum agents and that CBDCA should be excluded in patients who have received multiple platinum-based chemotherapy, even in platinum-sensitive cases, because CBDCA hypersensitivity can occur even with low-dose CBDCA administration.",0,0
476,15827670,Tuberculosis post-liver transplantation: a rare but complicated disease.,"Tuberculosis is a rare but serious complication after transplantation. We report a case and discuss its presentation and management.
A 60-year-old Indonesian male presented initially with fever, acute confusion and rapidly progressive right upper lobe pneumonia 3.5 months post-liver transplant, and was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis by positive sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli and tuberculosis culture.
Standard anti-tuberculosis therapy was administered but was complicated by interaction with cyclosporine and drug-induced cholestasis.
A high level of suspicion, prompt antituberculosis treatment and close follow-up are essential in management of post-transplant tuberculosis.",2005,3
477,15836666,Chronic fentanyl application induces adrenocortical insufficiency.,"We report a case of a 64-year-old man with secondary adrenocortical insufficiency who has been on a chronic transdermal fentanyl treatment because of sciatic pain syndrome. Shortly before admission to our hospital, the patient had discontinued his hydrocortisone medication. Adrenal crisis was assumed and during therapy with hydrocortisone infusion, the patient recovered. We suspected an opiate-induced suppression of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Therefore, we gradually reduced the opiate dosage. After 1 week, HPA axis function was markedly improved. We conclude that opiate medication may inhibit - in a life-threatening way - the organism's ability to respond to physical, emotional or metabolic stressors.",2005,5
478,15840734,Fluphenazine-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome in a schizophrenic patient.,"To report a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) associated with fluphenazine in a schizophrenic patient and review the literature related to this condition.
A 21-year-old African American male with schizophrenia came to our medical intensive care unit from the crisis intervention unit (CIU). He was hyperthermic (oral temperature 40.6 degrees C), diaphoretic, tachycardic (heart rate 140 beats/min), and tachypneic (respiratory rate 22 breaths/min), with severe muscle rigidity and shaking tremors. He had an extensive psychiatric history significant for schizophrenia and multiple past hospital admissions, starting at age 14 years. Two days prior to admission to the CIU, he had been given 25 mg of fluphenazine decanoate injection intramuscularly in addition to his regular psychotropic regimen of thioridazine and haloperidol after reportedly making several verbal threats and displaying aggressive behavior toward the personnel at the group home where he resided. Laboratory studies showed elevated creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, as well as azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and leukocytosis.
NMS is a rare but potentially fatal reaction associated with neuroleptic drugs. It occurs in approximately 0.07-2.2% of patients treated with neuroleptics. Risk factors include previous episodes, dehydration, agitation, polypharmacy, and the rate and route of neuroleptic administration.
An objective causality assessment revealed that fluphenazine was the probable cause of NMS in this patient. There was no reaction associated with thioridazine and/or haloperidol. Clinicians need to be aware of this drug-induced condition and the potential increased risk associated with concurrent use of multiple psychotropics.",2005,6
479,1584367,Intraventricular vancomycin-induced cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia: report of two patients.,"Pediatric neurosurgeons commonly instill vancomycin into the ventricles to treat shunt infections. This use for vancomycin, however, has not been studied in the laboratory to evaluate possible toxicities and side effects. We report two cases of cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia (CSFE) secondary to the intraventricular administration of vancomycin. Two other cases of shunt infection during the same time period were treated for only 2 days with intraventricular vancomycin and did not manifest CSFE. We address the clinical problems and possible detrimental effects of CSFE in the setting of shunt infection. We propose a mechanism of vancomycin-induced mast cell degranulation and subsequent release of eosinophil chemotactic factor as a cause of CSFE. An initial dose of intraventricular vancomycin should take into account volume of distribution (ventricular size) to obtain a peak cerebrospinal fluid concentration of 20 to 30 micrograms/mL. We recommend following daily cell counts and vancomycin peak and trough levels to calculate the amount and frequency of intraventricular vancomycin required to maintain safe and effective concentrations and to monitor for CSFE.",1992,4
480,15852680,"Successful recovery from interstitial pneumonitis, induced by bicalutamide and leuprorelin acetate given as treatment for prostate cancer.","We report a case of interstitial pneumonitis induced by bicalutamide and/or leuprorelin acetate given as therapy for prostate cancer, in which the pneumonitis was successfully managed by steroid treatment. Steroids were given promptly on the day following onset of pneumonitis, and the patient (72 years old) recovered almost completely within one and a half months. Interstitial pneumonitis, induced by hormone treatment given for prostate cancer, is a reversible condition and a quick diagnosis followed by prompt, proper treatment is important to ensure a successful recovery. The patient had been free of interstitial pneumonitis for 14 months, but died of pneumothorax.",2005,3
481,15857283,Corneal endothelial deposits associated with rifabutin use.,"The aim of this study was to report on the possible development of corneal endothelial deposits resulting from the use of rifabutin.
Case series consisting of 3 patients treated with rifabutin were retrospectively studied. Two of the patients were infected with human immunodeficiency virus. A corneal and external disease specialist performed a complete ophthalmologic exam and obtained medical histories of the patients.
All cases developed corneal endothelial deposits after previous use of rifabutin. The deposits were bilateral, yellow-white colored, stellate, and mainly peripheral.
In these 3 cases, the unique positive ocular finding was corneal endothelial deposits, which may be related to the use of rifabutin.",2005,4
482,15863610,Malignant mixed mullerian tumor of the uterus in a patient taking raloxifene.,"Uterine malignant mixed mesodermal tumor is a rare variant of uterine cancer. Data suggest that tamoxifen is involved in the pathogenesis. We report a case of a women in whom a malignant mixed mesodermal tumor was diagnosed while she was taking raloxifene, which is also a selective estrogen receptor modulator.
A malignant mixed mesodermal tumor was diagnosed in a 64-year-old woman with a bicornuate uterus while she was taking raloxifene for osteoporosis prevention. Diagnosis had been delayed secondary to sampling of the other uterine horn.
There may be an association between raloxifene and the development of malignant mixed mesodermal tumor. Special attention should be paid when attempting to sample the endometrium in patients with mullerian abnormalities.",2005,5
483,15866658,Mycophenolate mofetil-induced neutropenia in liver transplantation.,"Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a potent, safe immunosuppressive agent for rescue therapy of acute and chronic rejection in orthotopic liver transplant recipients. It helps to reduce the serious toxic side effects of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). The side effects of MMF, such as bone marrow toxicity, have been reported. Herein we report four patients who underwent liver transplantation and developed neutropenia while receiving MMF.
Between April 2002 and October 2003, we performed 24 liver transplants in 25 patients. Eighteen patients were given MMF for the following reasons: renal failure in nine (50%); treatment of acute rejection in three (16.6%); primary prophylaxis of rejection in five (27.7%); and CNI withdrawal in one (5.5%).
Of the 18 patients treated with MMF, there were 11 men (61.1%) and seven women (38.8%), with an overall mean age of 55.5 years. This therapy was ceased in four patients due to neutropenia (22%). Discontinuation of MMF was followed by a rapid and spontaneous rise in neutrophils in two patients. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) was administered to one patient and in another a bone marrow biopsy was performed due to persistent anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The mean time from starting MMF to the development of neutropenia was 4 months. Only the third patient showed elevated levels of MMF.
MMF is a potent immunosuppressive agent in liver transplantation. However, because serious hematologic toxicity has been reported, we recommend caution in administration and careful monitoring of blood levels.",2005,4
484,15878975,Disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with acute hemoglobinemia or hemoglobinuria following Rh(0)(D) immune globulin intravenous administration for immune thrombocytopenic purpura.,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed Rh(o)(D) immune globulin intravenous (anti-D IGIV) on March 24, 1995, for treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). A previous review described data on 15 patients who experienced acute hemoglobinemia or hemoglobinuria following anti-D IGIV administration for ITP or secondary thrombocytopenia. Eleven of those patients also experienced clinically compromising anemia, transfusion with packed red blood cells, renal insufficiency, dialysis, or death. That review suggested that patients receiving anti-D IGIV be monitored for those and other potential complications of hemoglobinemia, particularly disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Through November 30, 2004, the FDA received 6 reports of DIC associated with ""acute hemolysis"" (or similar terms), 5 of which involved fatalities. The attending or consulting physicians assessed that acute hemolysis or DIC caused or contributed to each death. This review presents the first case series of DIC associated with acute hemoglobinemia or hemoglobinuria following anti-D IGIV administration for ITP. The purpose of this review is to increase awareness among physicians and other health care professionals that DIC may be a rare but potentially severe complication of anti-D IGIV treatment. Increased awareness of DIC as a diagnostic possibility may enable prompt recognition and medical intervention in affected patients.",2005,9
485,15895899,Drug-induced agranulocytosis during treatment with infliximab in enteropathic spondyloarthropathy.,"Agranulocytosis is a disorder characterized by a severe decrease in the number of granulocytes in blood, that frequently occurs as an adverse reaction to some drugs. By now, there are no reports in literature of agranulocytosis caused by tumur necrosis factor-alpha blockers. We describe the case of a 20-year-old Caucasian male affected by enteropathic (Crohn's disease) spondyloarthropathy HLA B27 negative, successfully treated with infliximab. After the second infliximab infusion, he was found to have a severe transient neutropenia (0.5 x 10(9)/L). Routine serum chemistry and full blood cell count (apart from neutrophil count) were normal. Serology excluded an active infection. Bone marrow needle aspirate showed a normal trilineage differentiation. Autoantibody assessment showed negative ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-ENA, and ANCA, but positive granulocyte-bound antibodies (GBA) and neutrophil-specific (CD 16+)-bound antibodies (anti-NA). Ten weeks after infliximab infusion, neutrophil count and GBA and anti-NA assay returned spontaneously within normal range and we observed the same progress after every successive infliximab infusion we performed. These data indicated that infliximab possibly triggered production of granulocyte and neutrophil autoantibodies with resultant autoimmune agranulocytosis.",0,0
486,15907341,Efficacy and safety of linezolid in multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)--a report of ten cases.,"Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an increasing problem in many parts of the world and in Norway the increase has been substantial since 1998. New therapies for MDR-TB have not been introduced since the fluoroquinolones in the 1970s. The cure rate of this disease has been reported to be lower than for non-drug resistant TB, and the use of new experimental drugs in combination therapy is warranted.
Ten consecutive patients with culture proven MDR-TB were treated with the novel antibiotic drug linezolid in combination regimens for 6-40 (median 17) weeks and followed up 11-50 (median 24) months after end of treatment. All strains were sensitive to linezolid with MIC<4 mg/l. Treatment was given as direct observed therapy (DOT) and sputum cultures, blood chemistry and neurologic examination were undertaken on a regular basis.
Nine patients were cured, one patient with poor adherence to treatment and advanced AIDS died. Seven of 10 patients experienced serious adverse events, which led to withdrawal of linezolid in all seven. Six patients developed peripheral neuropathy and five patients bone marrow depression, blood transfusions were given to three patients and in all five patients bone marrow function normalized after cessation of linezolid. Peripheral neuropathy was not fully reversed in all patients.
Linezolid seems highly active in combination treatment of MDR-TB. Cultures became negative 10-37 days after the introduction of the drug. However, peripheral neuropathy and bone marrow depression led to linezolid withdrawal in seven patients, and neuropathy may not be fully reversible in all patients.",2006,2
487,15920338,High-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma after tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer.,"A case of high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, confined into an intrauterine polypoid growth, in a woman with a history of breast cancer who was treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. Based on the findings, a high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma was diagnosed. The patient underwent a total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with multiple omental biopsies. Pathological examination on multiple uterine sections showed the absence of residual tumor cells in the uterus. The endometrium showed patterns of glandular cystic hyperplasia. After 14 months of follow-up, the patient is well and free of disease. In deciding if tamoxifen therapy is warranted, all potentially life-threatening adverse events associated with tamoxifen should be considered, including endometrial adenocarcinoma or uterine sarcoma.",2005,0
488,15927910,Early-onset pentamidine-associated second-degree heart block and sinus bradycardia: case report and review of the literature.,"Although various manifestations of pentamidine-induced cardiotoxicity have been reported, to our knowledge, second-degree heart block associated with this agent has not been described. In addition, cardiac adverse effects usually develop after at least 6 days of therapy. We describe a 54-year-old, human immunodeficiency virus-positive man with a history of sulfonamide allergy who received treatment with pentamidine for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. After only the third dose of pentamidine, it was noted that the patient's heart rate had decreased to 48 beats/minute. Subsequently, five episodes of Wenckebach (Mobitz type 1) heart block with a ventricular rate of 28 beats/minute were observed on continuous cardiac telemetry. Serum electrolyte and creatinine levels remained within normal limits. Within 4 days of discontinuing the pentamidine, the patient's heart rate stabilized at 80 beats/minute without further intervention. Clinicians should be vigilant when monitoring for cardiotoxicity in patients receiving pentamidine throughout the duration of therapy. In addition, they should continue to reserve its use for moderate-to-severe Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia for which trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is ineffective or contraindicated.",2005,6
489,1592841,Falling backward in two elderly patients taking bupropion.,"Bupropion, a novel antidepressant, has been reported to produce fewer adverse effects than the tricyclic antidepressants. It has relatively weak effects on norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake but possesses significant dopamine agonist and reuptake blocking effects.
The case histories of two geriatric patients treated with bupropion for major depression are presented.
Both patients experienced a previously unreported side effect--falling backward--associated with bupropion use. Orthostatic hypotension and vertigo are not consistent with the patients' histories. Both patients manifested other symptoms consistent with parkinsonian syndrome.
This side effect, apparently unique to bupropion among antidepressants, may be mediated through dopaminergic effects in the basal ganglia. Clinicians should be alert to these potential problems in the geriatric population.",1992,5
490,15941649,Ophthalmologic and neurologic findings in two children exposed to vigabatrin in utero.,"Vigabatrin (VGB) is an important treatment option for infantile spasms. Vigabatrin-induced visual field defects are at present the most important safety issue in the use of the drug. The knowledge concerning VGB-associated visual dysfunction in pediatric patients, particularly in those who have been exposed to VGB in utero is limited. We explored ophthalmic and neurologic findings in two children who have been exposed prenatally to VGB.",2005,6
491,15944830,Clinical course of macular edema in two cases of interferon-associated retinopathy observed by optical coherence tomography.,"Interferon (IFN)-associated retinopathy is typically characterized by retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots at the posterior fundus, but visual function is usually maintained. With the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT), two patients with IFN-associated retinopathy who had developed macular edema and reduced visual acuity during the clinical course of IFN therapy were observed.
A 37-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C and a 59-year-old man with chronic myeloid leukemia, both of whom had received IFN therapy, were referred to our outpatient clinic. The former patient had complained once that his visual acuity had decreased after the termination of IFN therapy, and the latter patient complained twice during IFN therapy that his visual acuity had decreased.
In both patients, at the time of the visual disturbances, macular edema was clearly observed by OCT. Hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia were observed at this time also. After the remission of the hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia, the macular edema observed by OCT disappeared and visual acuity returned to normal.
During and after IFN therapy, OCT is a useful examination technique for revealing macular edema in patients who have decreased vision. Ophthalmologists should be aware of the ocular side effects of IFN therapy and carefully monitor patients for the possible occurrence of hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia.

492,15961942,Late development of diabetes mellitus after interferon-alfa and ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C: a case report.,"To report the late development of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus after completion of alfa-interferon therapy for hepatitis C in an Asian patient.
A 50-year-old male with chronic hepatitis C received treatment with alfa-interferon and ribavirin for 52 weeks. He developed immune-mediated diabetes mellitus with low C-peptide and positive antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody after completion of therapy. The hepatitis C infection was eradicated, but he continued to be diabetic requiring insulin therapy during the follow-up.
This report shows thatimmune-mediateddiabetes mellitus can occur as a late complication of alfa-interferon therapy.",0,0
493,15965422,Cutaneous necrosis after injection of polyethylene glycol-modified interferon alfa.,"Pegylated interferon alfa-2b is a formulation of recombinant human interferon conjugated with polyethylene glycol. Compared with standard interferon alfa injections, this preparation has a longer half-life allowing for once-weekly injections and superior antiviral efficacy in the treatment of hepatitis C when used in combination with ribavirin. Cutaneous side effects caused by interferon are well known. Cutaneous necrosis as a result of interferon alfa is an infrequent complication with unknown pathogenesis, in which a cutaneous local immune-mediated inflammatory process might be involved. We report 5 patients (3 patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with pegylated interferon alfa-2b in association with oral ribavirin and two patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia) who developed local cutaneous reactions at sites of injection after the administration of weekly subcutaneous injections of pegylated interferon alfa-2b at different doses. The ulcers slowly healed with local therapy, but two patients required dose modification of the pegylated interferon alfa-2b and one patient required treatment withdrawal. We review the literature on previously reported cases of cutaneous necrosis after injection of standard interferon alfa or pegylated interferon alfa-2b and discuss the different pathophysiologic mechanisms that might be involved.",2005,7
494,15977922,Tegaserod-associated ischemic colitis.,"Tegaserod, a potent partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT4 receptor, is used to treat women with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Since the drug's approval, the manufacturer has received infrequent although serious reports of diarrhea and ischemic colitis in patients taking the drug. These instances have led to a recent warning letter to physicians and a change in the prescription labeling of tegaserod. We describe the development of ischemic colitis in a woman who was treated with tegaserod and review the relationship among ischemic colitis, tegaserod use, and irritable bowel syndrome. Potential mechanisms involved in the occurrence of ischemic colitis in patients receiving tegaserod are also discussed.",2005,4
495,16001348,Lansoprazole-associated collagenous colitis: a case report.,"A 57-year-old man developed chronic, watery diarrhea four weeks after Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy including lansoprazole followed by lansoprazole monotherapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Four weeks later the patient was admitted to our hospital. By repeated testing other causes of diarrhea, e. g., infectious diarrhea including Clostridium difficile colitis were excluded. Endoscopy showed a normal colon, histopathology of random biopsies of all sections of the colon demonstrated the characteristic features of collagenous colitis. Withdrawal of lansoprazole lead to prompt and sustained relief. Two months later repeat colonoscopy with biopsies showed no evidence of collagenous colitis. Collagenous colitis as a subtype of microscopic colitis is a rare cause of chronic diarrhea with unknown pathogenesis. The reported case represents an unusual association between medication with the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole and the development of collagenous colitis suggesting the importance of evaluation of drug use in patients with microscopic colitis.",2005,7
496,16008658,Abdominal wall ulceration and mucinosis secondary to recombinant human interferon-beta-1b.,46-year-old woman developed painful ulcers over her lower abdomen in the form of reticulate erythema after injecting interferon beta-1b subcutaneously for multiple sclerosis. Skin biopsy revealed multiple superficial thrombosed vessels with focal epidermal necrosis as well as prominent interstitial mucinosis. Treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin followed by a heparinoid resulted in slow healing of the ulcers but also allowed the subcutaneous interferon injections to be continued.,2005,8
497,16012330,Itraconazole-related increased vincristine neurotoxicity: case report and review of literature.,"Itraconazole is particularly attractive in fungal prophylaxis for cancer patients due to its broad spectrum, including Candida and Aspergillus. It is generally well tolerated. However, its efficacy in preventing invasive aspergillosis could not be demonstrated. A 3-year-old boy diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia received induction chemotherapy. On day 14, itraconazole solution at a dose of 5 mg/kg was begun. Ten days after itraconazole was started, he developed paralytic ileus, neurogenic bladder, mild left ptosis, and absence of deep reflexes, with severe paralysis of the lower extremities and mild weakness of the upper extremities. Itraconazole withdrawal was followed by rapid improvement, with neurologic examination returning to normal within 6 weeks. Nineteen cases of unusual enhanced vincristine neurotoxicity related to itraconazole have been reported in children. Although the manifestations are the same as those usually associated with the use of vincristine, in these cases the severity appears remarkable. The authors suggest that in the absence of any proven benefit of itraconazole prophylaxis, and given the interaction of this drug with vincristine leading to severe and even potentially fatal toxicities, the combination use of these drugs should be avoided.",2005,7
498,16018164,Pseudoephedrine-induced hemorrhage associated with a cerebral vascular malformation.,"Sympathomimetic-related intracerebral hemorrhage is well-documented. Most cases are associated with phenylpropanolamine use.
We report a case of intracerebral hemorrhage occurring in a middle-aged man who suffered from chronic sinusitis and had been ingesting pseudoephedrine daily for one year. This patient was previously well with no known cardiovascular risk factors. Clinical examination revealed no evidence of vasculitis nor coagulopathy and initial neuroimaging (i.e., computed tomography, angiography, magnetic resonance imaging) demonstrated no features consistent with aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), cavernoma, nor cerebral metastases. A follow-up cerebral angiogram demonstrated a small AVM arising off a branch of the pericallosal artery and a small arteriovenous fistula arising off the costal marginal branch. The AVM was embolized without incident, however, the AVF was not accessible.
Sympathomimetics have long been associated with intracerebral hemorrhage. Since 1979, over 30 published case reports have documented the relationship between phenylpropanolamine and stroke. Only one report links phenylpropanolamine consumption to an intracerebral hemorrhage in a patient with an AVM. There is a paucity of literature etiologically inculpating other ephedra alkaloids in the causation of intracerebral hemorrhage. This is a case of pseudoephedrine-induced intracerebral hemorrhage in a patient with an underlying vascular malformation.",2005,5
499,16025424,Rapid onset of quetiapine-induced diabetic ketoacidosis in an elderly patient: a case report.,"New onset diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) among patients using atypical antipsychotics is of clinical importance [1,2,5,7-10]. Recently, atypical antipsychotics have been more widely used in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms with dementia (BPSD) than conventional neuroleptics because of a reduced tendency for movement disorders and psychomotor retardation. We report a case of reversible DKA and new-onset DM that developed in a demented patient who was treated with quetiapine for 14 days.",2005,7
500,1602800,Pulmonary leukostasis secondary to all-trans retinoic acid in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in first relapse.,"All-trans retinoic acid has recently been shown to induce differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. Clinical trials of patients treated de novo, in first relapse, and with resistant disease have achieved a high rate of complete remission (CR). The overall toxicity is substantially less than standard induction chemotherapy, with the notable exception of deaths attributed to the development of pulmonary leukostasis coinciding with a rapid increase in the number of mature neutrophils. This report describes a patient who developed pulmonary leukostasis in the absence of significant leukocytosis. The patient survived pulmonary leukostasis, resumed therapy, and achieved a CR. The case demonstrates features of leukostasis which are peculiar to the 'retinoic acid syndrome'.",1992,6
501,16029707,Eruptive epidermoid cysts resulting from treatment with imiquimod.,"Because of its unique mechanism of action and safety profile, imiquimod, a topical immune response modifier, is used for many benign and malignant dermatologic conditions. Adverse effects are typically limited to treatment site erythema and erosion.
To describe a newly recognized adverse effect of imiquimod.
A 79-year-old woman being treated with imiquimod 5 days per week for a nodular basal cell developed a verrucous plaque over the treatment area after 7 weeks of therapy.
Scouting biopsies demonstrated multiple comedones and ruptured epidermoid cysts. There was no evidence of residual basal cell carcinoma.
Imiquimod is a new and novel treatment option for cutaneous malignancies. We report its successful use in the treatment of a nodular basal cell carcinoma. The multiple comedones and ruptured epidermoid cysts are newly reported adverse effects of imiquimod therapy.",2005,7
502,16035204,Fatal fluoxetine ingestion with postmortem blood concentrations.,"A 37-year-old male ingested 12 gm of fluoxetine approximately 2 hours prior to arrival at an emergency department. The patient developed tonic-clonic seizures, which resolved with diazepam and midazolam therapy. The patient then developed profound bradycardia that progressed to ventricular fibrillation and asystole. A postmortem toxicology analysis reported a fluoxetine concentration of 4500 mcg/L and diazepam of 500 mcg/L. No other drugs were detected. We report an unusual case of massive fluoxetine ingestion resulting in neurological and cardiovascular toxicity resulting in death.",2005,0
503,16044093,Hepatocellular damage following therapeutic intravenous iron sucrose infusion in a child.,"The maximum tolerated single dose of intravenous iron infusion and iron pharmacokinetics are not known in children and not clear in adults. The case reported here is of a child given a large dose of intravenous iron sucrose (16 mg/kg) over 3 hours, who subsequently developed features of systemic iron toxicity. A TDM consultant discusses the case in the context of toxicokinetic analysis. Because the maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of intravenous iron preparations are not known, their use in both adults and children should still be undertaken with caution.",2005,8
504,160443,Transient global amnesia after clioquinol: five personal observations from outside Japan.,"Five personal observations of an acute amnestic episode in younger individuals after intake of clioquinol are described together with three observations from the medical literature. In five of these cases the episode began after an unusually large dose, in three after a therapeutic one with a latency of about 24 hours. The clinical aspect closely resembled classical transient global amnesia but the episode after clioquinol lasted longer (24 hours to three days) and a more or less extensive retrograde amnesia persisted permanently. In one patient after three tablets of Mexase a clioquinol concentration of 12 microgram/ml in plasma was found 24 hours after the specified dose, which is an unexpectedly high concentration compared to those reported as late as 24 hours after a single equal dose of Mexase or any other clioquinol-containing preparation. Another patient had a brief relapse two years after the first episode, after a single therapeutic dose of another clioquinol preparation.",1979,12

One patient was an 80-year-old woman who was admitted for Staphylococcus aureus knee arthritis after several intraarticular injections of sodium hyaluronate and corticosteroids. In the other patient, a 78-year-old woman, Neisseria mucosa knee arthritis occurred after a single sodium hyaluronate injection. Faultless aseptic technique is essential when administering hyaluronate viscosupplementation. Patients should be informed of the risk of septic arthritis.",2006,3
506,16062101,Acute dystonia induced by lamivudine.,"Lamivudine is the most widely prescribed drug of choice for chronic hepatitis B infection, which is a common health problem in China. Generally, the administration of lamivudine has been well tolerated. The authors report two cases of acute dystonic reactions (ADRs) as a side effect of lamivudine. ADR induced by drug treatment can be a side effect of treatment with antipsychotic drugs and other drugs; however, there have been no reports of lamivudine-induced ADR in the English literature. The authors think that although lamivudine is widely used and well tolerated, it can cause ADRs, which are reversible after drug withdrawal.",0,0
507,16087771,Pleuropulmonary fibrosis after long-term treatment with the dopamine agonist pergolide for Parkinson Disease.,"Dopamine agonists are increasingly used in the treatment of Parkinson disease, but they may cause serious adverse effects. In December 1983, symptoms of Parkinson disease developed in a 55-year-old man with no history of pulmonary disease, smoking, or asbestos exposure. He began treatment with dopamine agonists bromocriptine mesylate (in 1984) and pergolide mesylate (in 1989). In late 2000, pulmonary symptoms developed. Chest radiographs and computed tomographic findings showed a mass in the right upper lobe and effusion. A biopsy specimen showed pleural and parenchymal fibrosis. This syndrome resolved after cessation of pergolide therapy and a switch to pramipexole dihydrochloride. This case draws attention to the association of long-term ergot dopamine agonist therapy with pleuropulmonary fibrosis, which can develop as late as 11 years after the initiation of therapy. We also review evidence that the risk of this complication is substantially lower with the newer nonergot dopamine agonists.",2005,8
508,16092915,Risperidone-induced psychosis and depression in a child with a mitochondrial disorder.,"To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of an adolescent girl with a mitochondrial disorder and depression who displayed both new-onset psychotic and increased mood symptoms during treatment with risperidone.
A 16-year-old girl was treated with risperidone for mood lability and impulsivity at a community hospital. Within days, she developed paranoid ideation, profound psychomotor retardation, increased depression, and fatigue. She was transferred to an inpatient psychiatric hospital, where she was taken off risperidone. Within 48 hours after discontinuation of the medication, she had complete resolution of psychotic symptoms, fatigue, and psychomotor retardation, and her depression improved.
This observation of ""on-off"" risperidone treatment suggests that risperidone may have worsened both psychiatric and physical manifestations of the mitochondrial disorder in this adolescent. These findings are consistent with recent in vitro literature, which implicate a series of neuroleptic medications with mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, the authors provide diagnostic and treatment options that are available for mitochondrial disorders, which are of interest to child psychiatrists due to the central nervous system manifestations of these disorders.",2005,6
509,16097572,Fatal radiation myelopathy after high-dose busulfan and melphalan chemotherapy and radiotherapy for Ewing's sarcoma: a review of the literature and implications for practice.,"Radiation myelopathy is a rare, devastating, late effect of radiotherapy to the spinal cord. Spinal cord tolerance is currently accepted as about 50 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions. However, the effect of chemotherapy on cord tolerance is unclear. This issue is important, given the increasing use of chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy. We describe the case of a 17-year-old boy with a right apical paraspinal Ewing's tumour in the neck treated with induction chemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy (busulfan and melphalan) with peripheral stem-cell rescue and, 4 months later, radiotherapy to the primary tumour site (cervical cord received 50 Gy in 30 fractions). After a latent period of 4 months, he developed a progressive, severe and ultimately fatal radiation myelopathy, which we suggest was due to a synergistic interaction between the high-dose chemotherapy and the radiotherapy. The use of such chemotherapy regimens in Ewing's tumours should be carefully considered, particularly when radiotherapy encompassing the spinal cord is an essential component of management.",2005,8
510,16109609,Gemcitabine-induced pericardial effusion and tamponade after unblocked cardiac irradiation.,"Gemcitabine therapy has been associated with radiation recall reactions when used in the treatment of carcinoma. We report four cases of hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion in patients with refractory lymphoma who were receiving gemcitabine, all of whom had a history of mediastinal radiation without subcarinal blocking. All four patients had pericardial abnormalities on echocardiography prior to receiving gemcitabine. Two patients required emergent surgical procedures. Of twenty other patients in our practice who received gemcitabine for refractory lymphoma without developing pericardial effusion, none had received prior direct radiation to the heart. The overall response rate of these 24 refractory lymphomas to gemcitabine-containing regimens was 46%. Although gemcitabine-based regimens have clear efficacy in refractory lymphoma, prior mediastinal radiation without subcarinal blocking may be a relative contraindication, especially in the presence of pericardial abnormalities on echocardiography. Physicians should be aware of the potential for developing a gemcitabine-induced radiation recall reaction resulting in hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion.",2005,9

A patient with generalized MG was effectively managed with MM but developed CNS lymphoma after 3 years of treatment. Primary CNS lymphoma regressed on withdrawal of MM. Despite minimal short-term side effects and apparent efficacy, chronic treatment of MG with MM may be associated with increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders.",2005,8
512,16119501,Baclofen withdrawal: a cause of prolonged fever in the intensive care unit.,We report a case of baclofen withdrawal syndrome resulting from oral baclofen underdosing. A 24-year-old woman with type 1 neurofibromatosis receiving long-term baclofen therapy was admitted with presumed pneumonia which was successfully treated with antibiotics. The patient continued to have fever and autonomic instability without evidence of infection which entirely resolved within 24 hours of reinstitution of full preadmission dosing of oral baclofen. Baclofen withdrawal syndrome resulting from underdosing of oral baclofen should be considered as a potential source of prolonged fever in the intensive care unit.,2005,8
513,16132305,Captopril-induced pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia in an infant with congenital heart disease.,"We report a case of an infant with complex congenital heart disease who was placed on captopril for afterload reduction following cardiac surgery and subsequently developed pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia. The patient was readmitted with symptoms of rhinorrhea, poor feeding, and decreased activity level. She was found to have diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph and a marked peripheral eosinophilia without leukocytosis. After discontinuing captopril and starting systemic steroids, her symptomatology rapidly improved, and her eosinophilia and radiographic abnormalities both resolved.",0,0
514,16146480,Can propofol precipitate pancreatitis in patients with Cushing's syndrome?,"We encountered two cases of acute pancreatitis in patients with Cushing's disease following transnasal transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. In both cases propofol was used in bolus doses, and is thought to be the probable factor for its development. Since elevated cortisol levels in Cushing's disease poses a threat for pancreatitis, there is a possibility that patients with Cushing's disease might be more prone to acute pancreatitis following propofol administration. Anaesthesiologists and physicians dealing with the management of Cushing's disease need to be aware of this possibility.",2005,10
515,16156485,Lithium and ECT--concurrent use still demands attention: three case reports.,"Bipolar disorders as well as recurrent major depressive episodes can be most effectively treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Since continuation/maintenance ECT is not well established, prophylactic therapy in recurrent illnesses is more commonly carried out using antidepressive medication alone or more often in combination with lithium. In case of relapse the clinically important question of discontinuation of lithium versus the concurrent use of ECT and lithium may arise. The safety of concurrent use has also to be balanced when lithium treatment is started within an ECT course. Since recent studies have reported no negative interactions with concurrent use, we here report three cases (one case of a prolonged seizure, a serotonin syndrome and a focal seizure) of severe lithium-induced side effects while patients underwent ECT without complications and lithium serum levels were still subtherapeutic. Clinical consequences are discussed and disturbances of the blood brain barrier system as a speculative cause are hypothesized taking previous studies, animal studies and an additional reported clinical case into account.",2005,0
516,16160485,CD20-negative T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma as a progression of a nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab: a molecular analysis using laser capture microdissection.,"Rituximab is a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. It has shown efficacy in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and also in CD20-positive Hodgkin lymphoma. Recently, CD20-negative tumors have been described after Rituximab therapy. We report a 34-year-old man with a history of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), treated with different chemotherapy regimens, including anthracyclines and Rituximab. After 4 years in complete remission, he developed a CD20-negative T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma (TCRBCL) presenting as multiple lung lesions. This case shows the difficulties in the diagnosis of CD20-negative lymphomas when the number of tumor cells is low and when they are found in a predominant T-cell context. Using anti-CD79a as a B-cell marker is mandatory to overcome the difficulties in identifying these tumors. Moreover, this case illustrates the usefulness of laser capture microdissection to obtain purified cell populations for molecular studies in lymphomas with relative paucity of tumor cells, as well as the need to analyze different IgH gene regions to decrease the rate of false-negative results in PCR clonality studies.",2005,10
517,16167682,Transfusion haemosiderosis inspite of regular use of desferrioxamine: case report.,"We describe a case of a female who developed haemosiderosis, in the course of treatment for very severe unstable aplastic anaemia for fourteen years. She was 37 years old at the time of initial diagnosis. Her management consisted of regular blood transfusions aimed at haemoglobin above 8.5 g/dl, antimicrobials, oxymetholone, low dose prednisone and folate. She had received about seventy five units of blood at the start of 2 grams of desferrioxamine with every subsequent blood transfusion. Annual tests of serum ferritin showed progressive increase. She developed skin changes, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, recurrent infections, generalized joint and abdominal pains and liver failure. She died within six weeks of developing congestive heart failure coupled with liver failure due to haemosiderosis despite regular use of desferrioxamine.",2004,6
518,16181292,Severe loss of vision after removal of cataract caused by intravitreal triamcinolone in combination with photodynamic therapy for exudative age-related macular degeneration.,"Intravitreal triamcinolone has been suggested as an adjunctive to photodynamic therapy in the treatment of exudative macular degeneration. One of the side-effects of intravitreal triamcinolone is the development of cataract, and it is known that cataract extraction can exacerbate macular degeneration. A case is presented where combined intravitreal triamcinolone and photodynamic therapy stopped the progression of the exudative macular degeneration. Subsequent progression of cataract required cataract extraction, which resulted in a very rapid progression of the exudative macular degeneration and loss of vision.",2005,10
519,16192734,Rhabdomyolysis caused by tocolysis with oral ritodrine hydrochloride in a pregnant patient with myotonic dystrophy.,"Drug-induced rhabdomyolysis during pregnancy is extremely rare. We report here a rare case of ritodrine-hydrochloride-induced rhabdomyolysis in a pregnant patient with myotonic dystrophy. A 32-year-old primigravida was admitted because of premature labor at 31 weeks of gestation. She had been diagnosed as having myotonic dystrophy by electromyographic investigations and abnormal serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels. Tocolysis was initiated with oral ritodrine hydrochloride (15 mg/day) alone. There was a prompt response to the ritodrine hydrochloride. Three days after administration began, serum CPK levels had become markedly elevated to 10,897 mg/dl and myoglobinuria was detected (1,800 ng/dl), suggesting the presence of rhabdomyolysis. There was no evidence of worsening of the myotonic symptoms. Tocolysis was stopped immediately, and the laboratory data improved gradually. At 37 weeks of gestation, she spontaneously delivered a healthy male baby. Rhabdomyolysis has been recognized as a complication of tocolytic therapy with ritodrine hydrochloride. Therefore, beta-adrenergic agents should be used with great care, especially for patients with myotonic dystrophy, because of these agents' tendency to aggravate or precipitate myotonia and to induce rhabdomyolysis.",2006,0
520,16196187,Acute myocardial ischemia following accidental intravenous administration of epinephrine in high concentration.,"Inadvertent and accidental epinephrine overdose might result in potentially lethal complications. We present a case of acute epinephrine toxicity resulting in acute myocardial ischemia in a young boy with combined variable immunodeficiency syndrome who developed severe allergic reaction to intravenous immunoglobulin, and was subsequently given epinephrine by mistake intravenously rather than subcutaneously. He developed significant ischemic changes in standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, transiently raised cardiac enzymes, reduced left ventricular systolic function, pulmonary edema and pulmonary hemorrhage. It is suggested that special precautionary measures should be taken regarding the dose and the route while administering epinephrine to avoid mishaps.",0,0
521,16200540,Polysomnographic and pharmacokinetic findings in levodopa-induced augmentation of restless legs syndrome.,"Augmentation, defined as a loss of circadian recurrence with progressively earlier daily onset and increase in the duration, intensity, and anatomy of symptoms, not compatible with the half-life of the drug, is associated with dopaminergic treatment in restless legs syndrome (RLS) patients. The pathogenesis of augmentation is unclear. We describe a patient with idiopathic RLS who developed augmentation after 8 months of levodopa treatment. Videopolysomnographic and pharmacokinetic studies with monitoring of plasma levodopa levels demonstrated marked motor hyperactivity during augmentation, with anarchic discharges of motor unit potentials, tonic grouped discharges and flexor spasms, associated with painful dysesthesia. Symptoms and signs of augmentation were related to low plasma levodopa levels, abating 75 minutes after oral levodopa administration and reappearing after 3 hours, closely mirroring the rapid rise and fall of plasma levodopa concentration. This case is the first report in which RLS augmentation is shown to be characterized by motor hyperkinesias paralleling levodopa plasma pharmacokinetic profile.",2006,2
522,16204273,Infliximab and nephrotic syndrome.,"Infliximab is a chimeric tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) monoclonal antibody, which has been used extensively in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. It also appears to be effective in other conditions such as psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. The major side effect of infliximab is infection. Renal complications are uncommon and not well recognized. This report describes a probable case of infliximab-induced membranous nephropathy.",2005,12
523,16207263,Linezolid-induced dyserythropoiesis: chloramphenicol toxicity revisited.,We report here two cases of dyserythropoietic anaemia associated with long-term linezolid use that share striking similarities to chloramphenicol-associated myelotoxicity.,2005,10
524,1621023,Prominent eye movements during NREM sleep and REM sleep behavior disorder associated with fluoxetine treatment of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"The clinical polysomnographic (PSG) reports of 2,650 consecutive adults studied during 41 months were reviewed retrospectively to identify all patients treated with fluoxetine or tricyclic antidepressants. The PSG reports of four other adult groups were also reviewed: periodic limb movement (PLM) disorder (n = 28); sleep terror/sleepwalking (ST/SW) (n = 54); rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (n = 70); patients with clinically unremarkable sleep during two consecutive PSG studies (n = 30). Standard PSG recording and scoring methods were employed. A total of 1.5% (n = 41) and 2.0% (n = 52) of patients were receiving fluoxetine or tricyclics (amitriptyline or nortriptyline, n = 31; imipramine or desipramine, n = 16; protriptyline or trimipramine, n = 5). A selective association between fluoxetine and extensive, prominent eye movements in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was detected, utilizing Fisher's exact one-tailed statistic (p less than 0.00001 for each comparison). The detection rates were fluoxetine, 48.8% (20/41); tricyclics, 5.8% (3/52); RBD, 4.3% (3/70); objectively normal sleepers, 3.3% (1/30); PLM, ST/SW, 0% (0/82). These groups had similar mean ages (31.5-45.4 years) and gender distributions (50.0-60.7% male), apart from RBD. The effect of fluoxetine, a potent and specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on NREM eye movements is postulated to derive from potentiation of serotonergic neurons that inhibit brainstem ""omnipause neurons"", which, in turn, inhibit saccadic eye movements, thus resulting in disinhibited release of saccades. In addition, a 31-year-old man with obsessive-compulsive disorder developed RBD soon after starting fluoxetine therapy, which persisted at PSG study 19 months after fluoxetine discontinuation.",1992,6
525,16211208,Marked QT prolongation and torsades de pointes secondary to acute ischemia in an elderly man taking dofetilide for atrial fibrillation: a cautionary tale.,"Dofetilide has been shown to be effective and safe in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. Because of serious side effects of an increase in the QT interval causing torsades de pointes, dofetilide must be initiated with close monitoring of the QT interval in an inpatient setting. However, little has been reported about conditions surrounding the change in QT interval after the steady state is achieved that may have implications in the safety and efficacy of the drug. We report marked QT prolongation and torsades de pointes in a setting of flash pulmonary edema resulting from acute myocardial ischemia in a patient who was being treated with dofetilide for atrial fibrillation. Our case reminds the clinicians that the adverse and proarrhythmic effects of dofetilide can occur due to changes in the arrhythmic substrate during acute severe ischemia.",2005,9
526,16216617,Prominent positive U waves appearing with high-dose intravenous phenylephrine.,"A 71-year-old woman who had critical cerebral ischemia secondary to a carotid artery occlusion was receiving high-dose intravenous phenylephrine for a trial of hypertensive therapy. While on a maximal dose of phenylephrine she developed prominent positive U waves, which disappeared with the cessation of the drug. The possible underlying electrophysiological mechanisms of this phenomenon are discussed in this paper.",2005,10
527,16221163,Sirolimus-associated hepatotoxicity in the kidney graft recipient.,"The aim of our paper was to describe hepatotoxicity of sirolimus (SRL) in a kidney graft recipient. We report the case of a 30-year-old male after kidney transplantation, treated with steroids, cyclosporin A and SRL, with steroid-resistant acute rejection in anamnesis. At 16th month after transplantation, elevation of serum aminotransfereases was observed. After exclusion of common reasons of this condition, liver biopsy was performed. Nonspecific changes were observed, with probability of drug-induced injury. SRL was changed to mycophenolate mofetil, which was followed by quick normalization of serum aminotransferase levels. Hepatoxicity is a rare complication of SRL therapy and may be connected with some diagnostic and/or therapeutic problems. Conversion to another immunosuppressant seems to be an appropriate procedure in this condition.",2005,11
528,16225183,Nephrotic syndrome in a multiple sclerosis patient treated with interferon beta 1a.,"Interferon beta has become standard therapy for reducing relapse frequency in relapsing/remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). Several different preparations are available including interferon beta 1a (Avonex, Rebif) and interferon beta 1b (Betaferon/Betaseron). For the most part these preparations have been considered safe. Recently there have been concerns relating to liver and now kidney toxicity.
We present a case of a 28-yr-old male who developed a severe case of nephrotic syndrome while being treated for relapsing/remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) with weekly injections of interferon beta 1a. SUBSEQUENT COURSE: The nephrosis resolved almost completely once the interferon was stopped and after immunosuppressive treatment. At its peak the daily protein loss was 35.82 g. Kidney biopsy demonstrated membranous glomerulonephritis.
Two other case reports of nephrotic syndrome have been reported in the literature. This latest (third) report suggests that the safety profile should be reexamined and at least raises the question of potential renal toxicity of interferons in MS.",2005,8
529,16237130,Capecitabine-induced multifocal leukoencephalopathy: a report of five cases.,Capecitabine is used to treat advanced breast and gastrointestinal malignancies. A single case of encephalopathy and three cases of peripheral neuropathy are the only neurotoxicities reported. The authors report five additional cases of capecitabine-induced multifocal leukoencephalopathy.,2005,12
530,16239768,Venlafaxine-induced urinary incontinence resolved after switching to sertraline.,The authors report a case of urinary incontinence (UI) that occurred in a woman after administration of venlafaxine. UI resolved after discontinuation of the drug and did not reappear after switching to sertraline therapy. A 56-year-old white woman with a diagnosis of reactive depression developed severe UI after a 30 days' treatment with venlafaxine 75 mg/day. Symptoms resolved without consequence 48 hours after discontinuation of venlafaxine. The patient was then treated with sertraline without experiencing any incontinence episodes. Urinary incontinence is an important medical condition with clinical and social implications. Further studies need to be carried out to clarify the pharmacologic differences between dual and selective 5-HT and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors on lower urinary tract function.,0,0
531,1624172,Sustained hypothyroidism induced by recombinant alpha interferon in patients with chronic hepatitis C.,"Thyroid dysfunction has been reported in patients with malignant disease treated with recombinant alpha interferon. Two cases of hypothyroidism in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with recombinant alpha interferon are reported. In one patient, interferon induced hypothyroidism in the absence of pre-existing thyroid dysfunction and in the other it aggravated a pre-existing thyroid dysfunction. Both patients developed a severe, sustained hypothyroidism requiring thyroxine treatment for one year or more after stopping alpha interferon. Diagnosis of hypothyroidism during treatment can be difficult because of the common side effects of alpha interferon. Thyroid function should be assessed before and during alpha interferon therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C.",1992,6

533,16249064,Mycobacterium abscessus infection after use of tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor therapy: case report and review of infectious complications associated with tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor use.,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, such as infliximab and etanercept, are now frequently used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease. As an apparent result of their immune modulating activity, there has been an observed association between the use of these agents and the development of a wide range of infections, most notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We describe a case of infection with Mycobacterium abscessus in a 67-year-old woman receiving infliximab as a component of her therapy for RA. This case, along with extensive reports in the medical literature, illustrate how treatment with inhibitors of TNF-alpha has the potential to result in a wide range of infectious complications, including rapid growing Mycobacterium.",2005,11
534,16265343,Reversible cardiomyopathy caused by administration of interferon alpha.,"A 56-year-old man with normal cardiac function received treatment with interferon alpha-2b for malignant melanoma. Eight months after the initiation of therapy he developed fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Two months later, he was admitted to hospital with ORTHOPNEA, worsening dyspnea and cough. Physical examination findings were consistent with congestive heart failure. Laboratory studies were notable for hypothyroidism. Echocardiography revealed severe, global left-ventricular dysfunction.

535,16268429,Subacute cholestatic hepatitis likely related to the use of senna for chronic constipation.,"We report a case of senna-induced cholestatic hepatitis which was not diagnosed at presentation. A 77 year old male was referred with abdominal pain, jaundice and elevated transaminase levels. A diagnosis of extrahepatic cholestasis was first suspected, due to the observation of a duodenal diverticulum and dilated proximal choledocus. However, the sphincterotomy did not improve cholestasis. At further evaluation, HBsAg was positive but serological work up was compatible with a healthy-carrier status. Further interrogation of the patient revealed a history of chronic senna intake to treat a chronic constipation. Liver biopsy showed bridging hepatocellular necrosis as well as canalicular cholestasis. Drug withdrawal resulted in a slow and progressive reduction in bilirubin levels and liver enzymes. In this case senna was likely the cause of a subacute cholestatic hepatitis exemplifying again the potential role of herbal related liver injury.",0,0
536,16284443,Insulin-induced lipohypertrophy: report of a case with histopathology.,"An 82-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes had been treated with recombinant human insulin for 16 years. She developed large swellings in both sides of her lower abdomen. The masses were soft, painless, and located around her insulin injection sites. Based on the history and clinical features, a diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy was made. Total resection revealed that the lesions were composed entirely of fatty tissue. Microscopic examination showed nests of mature adipocytes expanding toward the dermal reticular layer. The hypertrophic adipocytes were twice as large as those from normal subcutaneous areas and contained numerous small lipid droplets. Electron microscopic analysis also revealed a minor population of small adipocytes, suggesting active differentiation or proliferation. Thus, the possible in vivo effects of insulin on adipocytes were clearly observed in this case of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy with detailed histological examinations.",2005,10
537,1628669,Diabetes mellitus and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in a girl with auto-immune haemolysis.,A 7-year-old girl developed diabetes mellitus and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency after 3.5 years of almost continuous treatment with azathioprine and/or prednisone for idiopathic auto-immune haemolytic anaemia. Although both drugs have been reported to preserve endogenous insulin secretion and to interrupt the diabetogenic process they may be responsible for diabetes and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in our patient.,1992,6
538,16288069,Penicillin-induced Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.,"To report a case of Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (JHR) in a patient with presumed neurosyphilis and HIV.
A 45-year-old HIV-positive man (CD4+ count 450 cells/mm(3) and history of AIDS-defining illness) presented with JHR after an initial intravenous dose of penicillin G for presumed neurosyphilis. The patient described feeling cold with worsening headache and chills approximately one hour after infusion of the first dose of penicillin. On examination, rigors, shallow inspirations, and chills were noted. He was afebrile, tachycardic, and tachypneic and had an oxygen saturation of 94% while breathing room air. His symptoms resolved within 10 minutes. Initially, this reaction was thought to be a result of a drug allergy, but upon further review, we determined that it was JHR.
It is not uncommon to confuse drug allergy with JHR. An objective causality assessment suggests that the JHR in our patient was probably related to penicillin. JHR is a self-limiting condition that warrants the continuation of antibiotic treatment in syphilis patients.
JHR should be an anticipated reaction to early doses of antibiotic treatment for treponemal diseases, such as syphilis. Treatment of JHR is largely supportive, such as administering antipyretic and antiinflammatory agents. Antibiotic treatment should be continued.",2005,12
539,16298824,Acute respiratory distress syndrome after rituximab infusion.,"Rituximab, a humanized monoclonal antibody approved for malignant lymphoma, is being increasingly, effectively, and safely used for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and other humoral autoimmune disorders. We report the case of a 43-year-old man with ITP refractory to steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after a single infusion of rituximab. Dyspnea, hypoxemia, and pleuritic chest pain occurred within 24 hours of rituximab administration, and there was no other apparent explanation. Progressive hypoxemia mandated endotracheal intubation 1 week after rituximab administration and led to death 4 weeks after admission. ARDS has been associated with the administration of other monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and OKT3 and is believed to be directly mediated by release of proinflammatory cytokines. ARDS is rarely associated with rituximab infusion for lympho-proliferative disorders, but it should be considered by those administering rituximab, especially when a patient develops severe pulmonary symptoms soon after infusion.",2005,11
540,16313549,Symptomatic hypocalcaemia and renal impairment associated with bisphosphonate treatment in patients with multiple myeloma.,"We report three cases of severe hypocalcaemia associated with i.v. bisphosphonate treatment in patients with multiple myeloma. All patients had symptomatic hypocalcaemia, including a tonic-clonic seizure and tachyarrhythmia in one case. Two cases were associated with the development of acute renal failure, whereas the third patient had pre-existing renal impairment. We recommend that bisphosphonates be used with caution in patients with myeloma and renal impairment, that vitamin D deficiency be corrected prior to treatment (to reduce the risk of hypocalcaemia) and that serum calcium and renal function be monitored during treatment.",2005,12
541,16317298,Gemcitabine-related radiation recall in a patient with pancreatic cancer.,"Radiation recall refers to inflammatory reactions triggered by chemotherapeutic agents and develops cutaneously in the previously irradiated areas. Such agents include anthracyclines, taxanes and capecitabine. Radiation recall related to gemcitabine has been reported in lung and breast cancer. Similar phenomenon associated with gemcitabine, the only FDA-approved drug for pancreatic cancer, is rarely reported. We report a patient with inoperable pancreatic cancer who developed gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to radiation-recall related to gemcitabine and review literature. A 57-year-old white male with unresectable pancreatic cancer received capecitabine in combination with radiation therapy followed by capecitabine alone given over approximately a 3-month time period. Computed tomography re-evaluation demonstrated a new liver lesion. The patient was then treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan. On day 15 of cycle 1, he reported progressive worsening of weakness and fatigue, and melena. Physical examination revealed hypotension (84/47 mmHg) and heme-positive stool on rectal examination. He denied aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Chemotherapy was held. Hematocrit was 20% (previously 33%). He was transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells. An esophago-gastro-duodenal examination was performed which showed antritis and duodenitis consistent with radiation therapy. A single site of oozing was injected with epinephrine. The diffuse gastritis was aggressively treated with proton pump inhibitors. The patient's hematocrit eventually stabilized and was 30% at discharge. Gemcitabine was not resumed. Radiation recall from gemcitabine is rare, but can potentially arise in any site that has been previously irradiated. Gemcitabine should be added to the list of drugs known to cause radiation recall. Treating physicians must be aware of this potential toxicity from gemcitabine either given concomitantly or followed by radiation. We suggest discontinuing gemcitabine if radiation recall is observed. Further studies are warranted into the pathogenesis of this unique phenomenon.",2006,1
542,16326413,High-dose methotrexate-associated acute renal failure may be an avoidable complication.,"A 17-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed acute renal failure within 48 h of an intravenous high-dose methotrexate (5 g/m2) infusion. His renal function returned to baseline 14 days later with supportive care, folinic acid rescue, and urinary alkalinization. A retrospective review revealed that the patient had been exposed to iopamidol, an intravenous contrast medium, on the day prior to the commencement of methotrexate treatment. Methotrexate-associated nephropathy is a rare complication in pediatric oncology, and a review of the literature suggests that exposure to nephrotoxic agents may be a significant but perhaps underrecognized risk factor for its development.",0,0
543,16341621,Massive prolapse of the urethral mucosa following periurethral injection of calcium hydroxylapatite for stress urinary incontinence.,"The injection of bulking agents into the urethral submucosa is designed to create artificial urethral cushions that can improve urethral coaptation and hence restore continence. Ideally, a urethral bulking agent should be non-immunogenic and biocompatible, leading to minimal inflammatory and fibrotic response. The authors present a case report of a granulomatous reaction leading to urethral prolapse, 3 months after the transurethral injection of calcium hydroxylapatite. To our knowledge, this is the first granulomatous reaction described after calcium hydroxylapatite injection.",2006,11
544,16352777,Probable loop diuretic-induced pancreatitis in a sulfonamide-allergic patient.,"To report the case of a patient with a prior allergy to a sulfonamide antibiotic who subsequently developed the same reaction when administered various loop diuretics.
A 57-year-old female with cardiomyopathy and ""sulfa"" (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) allergy documented as pancreatitis presented with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis after use of furosemide. She subsequently developed similar symptoms after multiple rechallenges with various loop diuretics including furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide. The patient was placed on ethacrynic acid until she was desensitized to furosemide. She had been receiving oral furosemide for 5 months at the time of this report, with no complications. According to the Naranjo probability scale, this reaction was probable.
Reactions associated with arylamine sulfonamide-containing antibiotics have been commonly reported; however, cross-reactions with non-arylamine sulfonamide-containing medications have been rare. The time delay by which symptoms of pancreatitis presented following administration of loop diuretics suggests an immunologic pathway. In addition, while cases of loop diuretic-induced pancreatitis, including furosemide, have been published, the allergic manifestations with both sulfonamide antibiotics and non-antibiotics in our patient suggest possible cross-reactivity between these 2 drug classes.
The mechanism by which loop diuretics induce pancreatitis appears to be via an immunologic pathway. While the true correlation remains unknown, allergic cross-reactivity may occur between sulfonamide antibiotics and non-antibiotics, such as loop diuretics. Torsemide appears to also be a part of a long list of agents that can cause pancreatitis.",2006,1
545,16355099,Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia complicated with massive thrombosis of the inferior vena cava after filter placement.,"A 45-year-old man presented with deep vein thrombosis of the right leg and bilateral pulmonary embolism. Heparin was administered on the initial one and a half days. On the 3rd day, an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed with a heparin flush, after which massive IVC thrombosis developed. The platelet count was 221000/mm3, decreased 42% from the initial level, but remained within the normal range. Heparin was replaced by argatroban on the 13th day. The platelet count increased to 355000/mm3 on the 15th day. The patient was positive for antibody against complexes of heparin and platelet factor 4, and was diagnosed as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome (HITTS). When thrombosis develops during heparin treatment, it is important to suspect HITTs and to assay for the associated antibodies, regardless of the actual platelet count.",2005,12
546,1635565,Gastric-outlet obstruction induced by prostaglandin therapy in neonates.,"An infusion of prostaglandin E1 is widely used to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus in neonates with congenital heart disease. After gastric-outlet obstruction was recognized in several infants who received prostaglandin E1, we studied the association between the drug and this complication.
We evaluated all neonates who received prostaglandin E1 in our hospital between October 1, 1989, and September 30, 1991, for clinical, radiologic, or pathological evidence of acute gastric-outlet obstruction.
Of the 74 neonates evaluated, 65 had no signs of gastric obstruction and were considered normal; 5 had clinical and radiologic or pathological evidence of gastric obstruction consistent with the presence of antral mucosal hyperplasia. The remaining four neonates had clinical signs of gastric obstruction, but no radiologic or pathological examinations were performed. The 5 neonates with antral hyperplasia had received prostaglandin E1 for longer periods (mean [+/- SD] duration, 569 +/- 341 hours) than the 65 normal neonates (54 +/- 58 hours, P less than 0.001) or the 4 neonates with clinical signs of gastric obstruction (119 +/- 60 hours, P less than 0.05). The cumulative dose of prostaglandin E1 was higher in the neonates with antral hyperplasia (2982 +/- 1392 micrograms per kilogram of body weight) than in the normal neonates (279 +/- 270 micrograms per kilogram, P less than 0.001) or the neonates with signs of gastric obstruction (528 +/- 306 micrograms per kilogram, P less than 0.01). In two neonates with antral hyperplasia, the cessation of therapy lessened the gastric-outlet obstruction.

547,16357738,Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus with thrombocytopenia treated with cyclosporine.,"Thrombocytopenia is one of the common manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Its treatment consists of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive drug such as azathioprine, vincristine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil. Common adverse reactions of immunosuppressive treatment are infections, hematologic and liver function abnormalities, but neurologic complications may also be seen. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) is a syndrome manifested by headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, cortical blindness, and visual disturbances. Neuroimaging shows bilateral subcortical and cortical edema with prominent posterior distribution. Moreover, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine, cisplatin, tacrolimus, and interferon-alpha can induce a condition resembling RPLS. We report a case of a young woman with SLE and thrombocytopenia, who developed severe perspiration, headache, and seizure after receiving cyclosporine. A brain magnetic resonance image showed multiple high signal intensities on T2-weighted images predominantly located at the parietooccipital lobe. The patient recovered completely clinically and radiologically after discontinuing cyclosporine.",2005,6
548,16368918,Possible interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir and valproic Acid exacerbates bipolar disorder.,"To describe a case of exacerbated mania potentially related to an interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir and valproic acid (VPA) and propose a mechanism of action for this interaction.
A 30-year-old man with bipolar disorder and HIV initiated treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. Prior to beginning therapy with these antiretrovirals, he was receiving VPA 250 mg 3 times daily, with his most recent VPA concentration measured at 495 micromol/L. Twenty-one days after starting antiretroviral treatment, he became increasingly manic. His VPA concentration at admission was 238 micromol/L, a 48% decrease. The daily VPA dose was increased to 1500 mg, and olanzapine was introduced. The VPA concentration following this dose escalation was 392 micromol/L, and the patient improved clinically.
Fifty percent of VPA is metabolized by glucuronidation, 40% undergoes mitochondrial beta-oxidation, and less than 10% is eliminated by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Ritonavir can induce glucuronidation of several medications including ethinyl estradiol, levothyroxine, and lamotrigine. We believe that ritonavir-mediated induction of VPA glucuronidation resulted in a decrease in VPA concentrations and efficacy. An objective causality assessment suggested that the increased mania was probably related to the decrease in VPA concentration and that a possible interaction exists between lopinavir/ritonavir and VPA.
A potential interaction exists between VPA and all ritonavir-boosted antiretroviral regimens. Clinicians should monitor patients closely for a decreased VPA effect when these medications are given concomitantly.",2006,1
549,16371793,Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide for persisting cystoid macular edema after penetrating keratoplasty.,"The intravitreal application of triamcinolone acetonide as treatment of long-standing, therapy-resistant cystoid macular edema after penetrating keratoplasty is reported.
A 44-year-old patient showed therapy-resistant cystoid macular edema for 2 years after repeated penetrating keratoplasty was performed as treatment of keratoconus. The crystalline lens was clear. The patient received an intravitreal injection of approximately 20 mg of triamcinolone acetonide. Preinjection visual acuity measured 20/80.
Within the first 4 weeks after the injection, dense cataract developed necessitating cataract surgery. After phakoemulsification, visual acuity improved to 20/50. Optical coherent tomography and fluorescein angiography showed an almost complete resolution of cystoid macular edema. Ten months after the injection, visual acuity remained at 20/50, and intraocular pressure measured 15 mm Hg without antiglaucomatous therapy taken.
Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide may be an additional tool in the treatment of therapy-resistant cystoid macular edema after penetrating keratoplasty. After intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide, cataract may rapidly develop in eyes that have been intensively treated, topically and systemically, by corticosteroids for several years.",2006,2
550,16393774,Arthritis and bursitis in multiple sclerosis patients treated with interferon-beta.,"Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is a type I interferon used in the management of multiple sclerosis. Therapy with IFN-beta has rarely been associated with the development of autoimmune disorders. We present the cases of two female patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who developed inflammatory musculoskeletal manifestations, following IFN-beta therapy. The first patient developed a monoarthritis 2 weeks after initiation of IFN-beta, which persisted during the 14 months of therapy and resolved with discontinuation of the medication. The second patient developed both autoimmune thyroid disease and a refractory pre-patellar bursitis after 50 months of IFN-beta therapy. Our literature review revealed an additional six cases of onset of inflammatory arthritis in MS patients receiving IFN-beta. We review these reports with comparison to our two cases. The role of IFN-beta in inflammatory musculoskeletal disease is unclear. The potential autoimmune complications of this therapeutic agent should be comprehended when monitoring patients receiving such treatment.",0,0
551,16396068,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-induced aseptic meningitis.,"We present a 46-year-old African-American man with AIDS who was admitted on two different occasions within three weeks for signs and symptoms of meningitis after using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). TMP/SMX is primarily used for the treatment of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis in AIDS patients. Drug-induced aseptic meningitis (DIAM) is commonly seen with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), antibiotics (with TMP/SMX being the most frequently implicated), intravenous immunoglobulins and OKT3 antibodies. However, the implication of TMP/SMX inducing aseptic meningitis has been underreported to FDA/MEDWATCH program. This might be due to the fact that it has also been used to treat bacterial meningitis from organisms like Listeria monocytogenes, which is a common pathogen in the elderly and in infants. We reviewed the literature in an attempt to characterize the pattern and predictors of TMP/SMX-induced aseptic meningitis.",2005,12
552,16404563,Nocardiosis in a patient with primary anti-phospholipid syndrome.,"Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disease that is characterised by tendency to thrombosis, obstetrical and hematological complications. Corticosteroids may be useful for therapy of some features of this syndrome, such as thrombocytopenia. Nocardia is an important opportunistic infectious agent in immunocompromised hosts, i.e. in patients taking corticosteroids. It is important to be aware of these rare complications, which are correlated with the prognosis. In this paper, we report a patient with primary anti-phospholipid syndrome treated by corticosteroid, who developed disseminated nocardiosis.",2006,3

554,16411025,Diffusion-weighted MRI correlates of subacute methotrexate-related neurotoxicity.,"A delayed stroke-like leukoencephalopathy has been observed in patients receiving methotrexate (MTX) for childhood leukemia. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) may help to distinguish between ischemic stroke and chemotherapy-related leukoencephalopathy. Although conventional MRI correlates have been described for this stroke-like syndrome, DWI data are largely unavailable. Our objective is to present a retrospective analysis of the DWI findings in four patients who suffered subacute neurotoxicity after intrathecal MTX.
We reviewed the medical records of four patients, who were seen by us between July 2000 and February 2004 for sudden onset of a central neurological syndrome within days of intrathecal MTX. Patients underwent standardized MRI within 48 h of symptom onset; MRI included DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.
DWI of all patients revealed well-demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter corresponding to areas of restricted proton diffusion on ADC maps. Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories. Complete resolution of symptoms within 1-4 days was accompanied by normalization of ADC abnormalities.
DWI findings in this cohort seem to reflect cytotoxic edema within cerebral white matter suggesting a reversible metabolic derangement, rather than ischemia, as the basis for this syndrome.",2006,1
555,16416684,Prolonged requirement for ventilatory support in a patient with Eskalith overdose.,"Lithium (Eskalith) is commonly used in the treatment of depressive and bipolar affective disorders, in a population at relatively high risk for overdose. Lithium may help correct a chemical imbalance in the brain; however, it has a comparatively narrow therapeutic index. Thus, lithium intoxication is a frequent complication of chronic lithium therapy. The central nervous system (CNS) is the major organ system affected, although the renal, gastrointestinal (GI), endocrine, and cardiovascular (CV) systems also may be involved. Here we present a forty-two-year-old Caucasian female with altered mental status, inability to eat, speak or walk properly, with shaking and vomiting for three days. Past medical history was significant for hepatitis C and bipolar disorder. Vital signs were within normal limits. Physical exam revealed a patient with aphasia, tremor, and an expressionless face, able to make eye contact and move all four extremities. However, she was unable to follow commands and she expressed rigidity of extremities, mild tachycardia, and stupor. Severely elevated serum lithium levels were found. A diagnosis of severe lithium toxicity was made and the patient was admitted to the telemetry unit. Intravenous hydration with normal saline was initiated as the patient had normal kidney function, and urinary output was monitored. All psychotropic medications were held except for a benzodiazepine. In the meantime the patient developed acute respiratory distress, was intubated on clinical grounds and was transferred to the intensive care unit. Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and other causes of respiratory distress were ruled out; diagnosis of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was made. After two months of mechanical ventilation, the patient was stabilized. Mental status, vital signs, and all laboratory parameters including thyroid function tests, normalized. The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation center. This is a rare case of ARDS associated with lithium intoxication.",2005,0
556,16421117,Dyskinesias induced by subthalamotomy in Parkinson's disease are unresponsive to amantadine.,"Dyskinesias are a transient but severe complication of subthalamotomy in some patients.
Three patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing bilateral micro-recording guided surgery of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are described; deep brain stimulation (DBS) was used in one case, and subthalamotomy in the other two. Prior to surgery, levodopa induced dyskinesia had improved (< or = 50%) under treatment with amantadine (400 mg/day, po) in all three patients. The patient treated with DBS developed severe dyskinesia a few days after discharge and began self medication with amantadine but showed no improvement. This suggested a possible lack of response to amantadine for treatment of dyskinesias induced by surgery of the STN.
Both patients treated with bilateral subthalamotomy developed unilateral choreoballistic movements immediately after surgery, despite not taking levodopa (L-dopa). Patients were scored using the dyskinesia scale and started treatment with 400 mg amantadine (po) for 4 days within the first postoperative week with no effect on dyskinesia score or its phenomenology. Amantadine was therefore discontinued. One month after surgery both patients were free of involuntary movements with an improvement of about 60% in the ""off"" state UPDRS motor score. Six month follow up showed maintained antiparkinsonian benefit, without need for levodopa treatment and complete absence of dyskinesia.
The present findings suggest that: (i) amantadine probably exerts its anti-dyskinetic effect by acting on the ""indirect"" pathway; (ii) the pathophysiological mechanisms of subthalamotomy induced dyskinesias may differ from those involved in L-dopa induced dyskinesias; (iii) dyskinesias induced by STN surgery resolve spontaneously as compensatory mechanisms develop.",2006,2

558,16432996,Development of sarcoidosis during interferon alpha 2b and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C--a case report and review of the literature.,"Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous multisystemic disorder of unknown aetiology. Although interferon gamma has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis, only a few cases of sarcoidosis associated with interferon alpha therapy have been reported. We report a case with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who developed sarcoidosis after the treatment by interferon alpha and ribavirin. The combination therapy of interferon alpha and ribavirin was given to a 50-year-old female with CHC who had not responded to a previous treatment by interferon alpha. She has been admitted with non-productive cough, dyspnoea and fever 11 months after the initiation of combination therapy. Chest x-ray and thorax computed tomography revealed bilateral hilar masses and nodular infiltrations in the lung parenchyma. Pulmonary function test showed a mild restriction. Biopsy of mediastinal lymphadenopathy revealed noncaseating granuloma. She was diagnosed to have pulmonary sarcoidosis at stage II, and the combination treatment was discontinued. Her symptoms regressed after inhaler steroid treatment. Six months after the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, the patient was asymptomatic and a complete sustained response to hepatitis C was achieved. During the three years of follow-up, both pulmonary sarcoidosis and hepatitis C have not recurred. We suggest that sarcoidosis may develop in chronic hepatitis C patients during interferon alpha and/or ribavirin treatment, and diagnostic tests for this adverse effect should be performed during the follow-ups.",0,0
559,16436462,Neutropenic colitis during standard dose combination chemotherapy with nedaplatin and irinotecan for testicular cancer.,"A 54-year-old man received combination chemotherapy with nedaplatin and irinotecan as salvage chemotherapy for refractory non-seminomatous testicular cancer. The patient developed abdominal pain and high fever on Day 21 after the initiation of chemotherapy. Computed tomography revealed thickening of the terminal ileum wall and paralytic ileus. The patient recovered with intensive supportive management including broad-spectrum antibiotics, bowel rest with gastric intubation and intravenous gamma-globulin. Neutropenic colitis has been thought to be a serious gastrointestinal complication associated with chemotherapy for hematological malignancy. The mortality rate is as high as 21-48% according to a recent review. The present case indicates that the neutropenic colitis can occur under neutropenic conditions induced by the standard-dose chemotherapy for solid cancer.",2006,1
560,16441824,Looking at calcimimetics impact on hypercalcemia of immobilization: hypotheses and a case study.,"For the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPTH-II) in dialysis patients and hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. Calcimimetics are a new class of drugs approved in the European Community and the United States by the Food and Drug Administration that were designed to suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels with a simultaneous reduction in serum calcium and phosphorus levels, and calcium phosphorus product (Ca x P). Hypocalcemia is a frequent finding during the correction phase of the HPTH-II with calcimimetics. By contrast, the appearance of a hypercalcemia has yet to be described. In this paper, we report a case of severe hypercalcemia of immobilization in a 40-year-old hemodialyzed woman treated by cinacalcet HCl for a severe HPTH-II (PTH>1,000 pg/mL). A kidney transplantation recipient 1983 to 1995, she was diagnosed with Charcot-Marie Tooth disease in 1991. She had multiple orthopedic interventions for kidney-related osteoarticular problems probably favored by the kidney graft and the immunosuppressive treatment. While she was receiving the maximum dose of 180 mg/day of cinacalcet HCl and PTH at 443 pg/mL, she needed to be hospitalized for a right hip prothesis. Two weeks after the intervention she developed a symptomatic hypercalcemia of 3.57 mmol/L which was resistant to several measures including lowering the calcium concentration in the dialysate, withdrawing all vitamin D and calcium supplementation and the administration of calcitonin. Her serum calcium level was finally stabilized in the 2.37-2.95 mmol/L by administration of a single intravenous dose of pamidronate. This observation illustrates that the pharmacological activation of the parathyroid CaR and other putative CaR on bone cells by calcimimetics did not protect against the occurrence of hypercalcemia of immobilization favored by a severe HPTH-II in a hemodialysis patient.",2006,1
561,16446228,Reversible sirolimus-associated pneumonitis after heart transplantation.,"Sirolimus (rapamycin) and everolimus are immunosuppressive agents that inhibit cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Sirolimus has been widely used in renal transplantation, and its use in heart transplantation is increasing. Sirolimus-associated pneumonitis has been described in renal transplant patients. Two cases of sirolimus-associated pneumonitis have been reported after cardiac transplantation. Only 1 case has been described in detail, and this had a fatal outcome. Here, we present a case of sirolimus-associated interstitial pneumonitis in a cardiac transplant recipient that resolved completely with withdrawal of the drug and treatment with corticosteroids.",2006,2
562,16449538,Nonconvulsive status epilepticus due to ifosfamide.,"To report 2 cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) following infusion of ifosfamide.
Two patients who received ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy developed NCSE. One woman received ifosfamide 1000 mg/m2 (1 h infusion on days 1-5); confusion, lethargy, and speech deterioration developed on day 3. The second patient developed similar symptoms on day 3 of treatment with 2500 mg/m2. Both patients responded to intravenous administration of diazepam 10 mg and were given levetiracetam as maintenance therapy.
The severity and presentation of central nervous system toxicity due to ifosfamide varies greatly and involves a spectrum ranging from subclinical electroencephalogram changes to coma. NCSE, an epileptic disorder in which typical convulsive activity is absent, has previously been reported in only 4 patients receiving ifosfamide. Levetiracetam may be used for maintenance antiepileptic therapy after diazepam administration.
Among the many presentations of ifosfamide neurotoxicity, clinicians should consider NCSE as a possible explanation for changes in consciousness in a patient receiving this agent. An objective causality assessment by use of the Naranjo probability scale revealed that NCSE due to ifosfamide was probable.",2006,2
563,16453964,"Intraoperative anaphylaxis: verba volant, scripta manent!","We describe a case of intraoperative gelatine-induced anaphylaxis whose diagnosis was delayed as the use of gelatine during surgical procedures was omitted for two times in patient's medical records. The subject is a 66-year old woman, with a negative medical history of atopy, food and drug allergy, with arterial hypertension on a course of beta-blockers and with bladder carcinoma requiring surgery. The patient had tolerated both general and local anaesthesia on several previous occasions. On the first occasion she experienced arterial fibrillation secondary to a severe episode of hypotension following local anaesthesia, while on a course of beta-blockers. On the second occasion she developed a very severe episode of hypotension followed by the outbreak of a generalised rash during general anaesthesia. The tryptase sera level was 109 mg/L one hour after the reaction had subsided, while the basal values were normal. On the third occasion the patient redeveloped severe hypotension and a generalised rash during general anaesthesia. The allergological work-up was negative, except for intradermal test with gelatine. A study of the intra-cellular cytokines in blood lymphocytes showed a production of IL4 from CD4+ lymphocytes after stimulation by gelatine. The patient underwent a successive surgical procedure without any adverse event.",2005,11

565,16463436,Desensitization to hydroxychloroquine--experience of 4 patients.,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an antimalarial agent with immunomodulatory effects. It is widely used in rheumatologic diseases, and has a very high efficacy/toxicity ratio. It is particularly important in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) since it reduces new organ involvement and disease flares, and relieves skin and joint symptoms. Some patients develop hypersensitivity rash in response to HCQ. In such patients the drug is withdrawn and replaced by another medication. All the alternative medications for rheumatological patients are significantly more toxic than HCQ. We describe our initial experience of HCQ slow oral desensitization. All 4 patients who were recruited completed the procedure successfully without significant difficulty. Our results suggest that HCQ slow oral desensitization is safe, effective, and easy to perform.",2006,4
566,16472339,The risks of sumatriptan administration in patients with unrecognized subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).,"Administration of sumatriptan in subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) patients, misdiagnosed as migraine patients, may induce symptomatic cerebral vasospasm with potentially dangerous consequences. Over a 5-year period, we observed three patients with a 3-15-year history of migraine, who received sumatriptan for acute headache. Two patients received 6 mg sumatriptan subcutaneously on days 4 and 6, and one patient 3 x 100 mg sumatriptan orally on day 1 after an acute headache episode. In all three cases, an alleviation of headache intensity from severe to moderate was observed. When headache recurred and meningeal signs appeared, SAH was diagnosed by computed tomography in all three cases. No neurological deficits occurred during the further course of the disease. In both patients with a SAH caused by an aneurysm, transcranial Doppler sonography demonstrated vasospasm of the basal cerebral arteries. An antinociceptive effect of sumatriptan can be observed in SAH patients in good clinical condition, which suggests a specific craniovascular antinociceptive action. This may lead to misdiagnosis as migraine and delayed appropriate diagnosis and treatment.",2006,3
567,16480245,Diabetes associated with atypical antipsychotic treatment may be severe but reversible: case report.,"To draw attention to severe presentations of atypical neuroleptic related diabetes and to document that a marked degree of remission can take place after drug withdrawal.
We describe two patients who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis after treatment with quetiapine and risperidone, respectively.
Both patients were negative for islet cell antibodies. They both required treatment with insulin, one in very high dosage, but their insulin requirements fell progressively after the atypical antipsychotic was withdrawn. After several months, neither patient required antidiabetic treatment.
Atypical antipsychotic-induced diabetes does not always take a ""type 2"" presentation in which weight gain and insulin resistance are implicated. Sometimes the presentation is with diabetic ketoacidosis, requiring insulin treatment, which can nevertheless be reversible.",2005,0

After the withdrawal of TMP-SMX and the administration of high-dose steroid, these systemic symptoms gradually resolved. During the disease course, the patient showed a transient increase in anti-human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 antibody titers and HHV-6 DNA in the peripheral blood, indicating the reactivation of a latent HHV-6 infection.

570,16498048,Interferon-alpha-induced hyperthyroidism: a three-stage evolution from silent thyroiditis towards Graves' disease.,"Autoimmune thyroid disease is a common side-effect of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment of viral hepatitis C. We have described three patients with hepatitis C for whom IFN-alpha and ribavirin were prescribed and who developed two successive phases of silent thyroiditis followed by hyperthryroidism relapse due to Graves' disease. These three men had no known history of familial or personal thyroid disease. Destructive thyrotoxicosis appeared 4-6 months after starting IFN-alpha, followed by Graves' hyperthyroidism within 8 to 11 months. The thyrotropin (TSH) level was normal before IFN-alpha was started. The diagnosis of destructive thyroiditis was confirmed by anti-TSH receptor antibody (TSHRAb) negativity and the absence of radionuclide ((123)I or (99)Tc) uptake on thyroid scintiscans. Eight to eleven months after starting treatment, TSHRAb positivity and intense scintigraphic uptake confirmed the appearance of Graves' disease. IFN-alpha was continued in only one patient. Hence, hyperthyroidism induced by IFN-alpha could correspond to the first phase of silent thyroiditis, to Graves' disease or to the succession of both. Rigorous diagnostic procedures with repeated scintiscans and TSHRAb titering are necessary to avoid a false diagnosis and inappropriate therapy.",2006,3
571,16503727,Dipyrone-induced granulocytopenia: a case for awareness.,"Dipyrone, also known as metamizole, is an analgesic and antipyretic drug that was banned by the United States Food and Drug Administration because of its association with agranulocytosis. However, it is still produced and marketed in several countries in Central and South America as well as in Europe, Asia, and Africa. It can also be found in the United States, where illegal sales have been reported in California gift shops, markets, bakeries, and other retail establishments. Dipyrone is commonly found in the homes of families who are originally from areas where it is still lawfully marketed. We describe a patient who developed granulocytopenia and fever after taking dipyrone and discuss the available literature. Our aim is to raise awareness of this drug, which is commonly used outside the United States, and to call attention to its well-known and potentially lethal side effect.",2006,3

574,16515630,Fatal pulmonary fibrosis induced by paclitaxel: a case report and review of the literature.,"Fatal lung fibrosis caused by paclitaxel toxicity has not been reported In this report, we describe the case of a 62-year-old woman who received six cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin as combination chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer. Four weeks after the end of the chemotherapy she developed interstitial pneumonitis and irreversible lung fibrosis. Despite treatment with corticosteroids, she had rapid deterioration and died of respiratory failure. Pulmonary fibrosis is a complication of paclitaxel therapy that may occur despite treatments with corticosteroids. While reviewing the literature, we found few less severe pulmonary injuries after intravenous use of paclitaxel, but none of these cases had a fatal outcome. Physicians should keep in mind that taxanes such as paclitaxel have the potential to cause pneumonitis and lung fibrosis.",0,0
575,16521231,Subfulminant hepatitis B after infliximab in Crohn's disease: need for HBV-screening?,"Infections are a major adverse effect during the treatment with anti-TNF-alpha. While exclusion of any bacterial infection and screening for tuberculosis are mandatory before initiating a therapy with anti-TNF-alpha-antibodies, there are no guidelines whether to screen for or how to deal with chronic viral infections such as hepatitis B. In this case report, we have described a patient with Crohn's disease who developed subfulminant hepatitis B after the fourth infusion of infliximab due to an unrecognized HBs-antigen carrier state. He recovered completely after lamivudine therapy was started, but this severe adverse event could have been prevented if screening for HBV and pre-emptive therapy with lamivudine would have been started prior to infliximab. We therefore strongly argue in favor of extended screening recommendations for infectious diseases including viral infections before considering a therapy with infliximab.",2006,2
576,16527771,Acute unilateral total visual loss after retrogasserian phenol injection for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia: a case report.,"Phenol is a neurolytic agent that is widely used by percutaneous retrogasserian injection in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. We report a 78-year-old man who had acute unilateral total visual loss after retrogasserian phenol injection for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The patient's visual acuity, eye movements and the pupillary defect did not improve in the affected eye even after mechanical decompression within 30 minutes and medical treatment, neither in the early period nor during the following two months. The visual loss in this patient seems to result from phenol neurotoxicity rather than mechanical compression of the intraorbital optic nerve. This case demonstrates that although percutaneous retrogasserian phenol injection is a relatively safe and noninvasive method of treatment for trigeminal neuralgia, severe complications may occur.",2006,3

Several hypersensitivity reactions to cloxacillin have been reported, although IgE-mediated allergic reactions to the drug are rare and there is little information about possible tolerance to other semisynthetic penicillins or cephalosporins in patients with cloxacillin allergy. We present 2 patients with demonstrated IgE-mediated allergy to cloxacillin and tolerance to amoxicillin and cefuroxime.
Case 1. A 47-year-old woman began treatment with cloxacillin due to acute cellulitis. After ingesting 500 mg of the drug, she experience generalized maculopapular eruption and facial angioedema. Case 2. A 55-year-old woman presented an episode of acute urticaria and labial angioedema 60 minutes after ingesting 500 mg of cloxacillin for a skin abscess.
Skin prick tests were positive to cloxacillin in case 1 and negative in case 2. However, an intradermal test was positive to cloxacillin (2 mg/ml) in case 2. Simple-blind oral challenge tests with amoxicillin (1 g) and cefuroxime (500 mg) were well-tolerated by both patients.
We present 2 patients allergic to cloxacillin with normal tolerance to other betalactam antibiotics, confirming that cross-reactivity among these antibiotics seems to be uncommon. Complete allergy study, including an oral challenge test, should be considered in these patients.",0,0
579,1655228,Myocardial ischemia associated with high-dose carmustine infusion.,"Carmustine (BCNU), a nitrosourea derivative, is an antineoplastic agent used recently for the treatment of human solid tumors and lymphomas in high doses with autologous bone marrow transplantation. Cardiac toxicity related to BCNU has not been described well. Three patients are reported without a history of angina pectoris who had clinical and electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia during and immediately after BCNU infusion. The incidence, cause, and mechanism of such a side effect are unknown but should be considered in patients receiving high-dose carmustine infusions.",1991,11
580,16599252,Adverse reaction in a patient with aspirin-induced asthma treated with zafirlukast.,Asthmatic patients receiving antileukotrienes may develop hypereosinophilia as a part of a Churg-Strauss syndrome. It is unclear if this effect is directly related to the administration of antileukotrienes or a consequence of the corticosteroid-sparing effect of antileukotrienes unmasking a Churg-Strauss syndrome. We present a case of hypereosinophilia related to zafirlukast therapy. The patient did not fulfil criteria for Churg-Strauss syndrome. Symptoms and laboratory findings improved after zafirlukast was removed.,2006,0
581,16603845,Pyoderma gangrenosum related to a new granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.,"A 23-year-old Caucasian man diagnosed with stage IVB Hodgkin's disease was referred to a university oncology section after completing 1.5 cycles of chemotherapy. His chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin HCL, bleomycin, dacarbazine, and vinblastine, with prophylactic administration of a granulocyte colony stimulating factor. He had developed postchemotherapy complications of possible cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis that required wound debridement. The wound and tissue cultures were negative. Biopsies taken at the time revealed a dense inflammatory infiltrate consistent with an abscess. Over the course of 2 months, the wound healed with systemic antibiotics. The patient was reluctant to resume chemotherapy for his Hodgkin's disease because of his previous presumed skin infections. However, positive emission tomographic scanning revealed disease progression. Doxorubicin, bleomycin, dacarbazine, and prophylactic pegfilgrastim (a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), were administered. Vinblastine was excluded from the new regimen. Shortly after chemotherapy and an injection of pegfilgrastim, the patient developed poorly defined, rapidly progressive erythema, edema, and pain in his right forearm. He presented to the emergency room, was evaluated by the orthopedics service, and taken to the operating room for debridement of suspected necrotizing fasciitis. When the dermatology service consulted the following day, the patient had developed an erythematous, edematous, tender plaque on his chest. After developing two additional lesions that began to ulcerate despite treatment with imipenem, vancomycin, clindamycin, rifampin, and gentamicin, the patient consented to a skin biopsy. His wound cultures continued to be negative.",0,0
582,16609346,Statin-associated myasthenia gravis: report of 4 cases and review of the literature.,"A few recent individual case reports have suggested that a myasthenic syndrome may be associated with statin treatment, but this association is not well described. We report 4 patients who developed symptoms of myasthenia gravis within 2 weeks of starting treatment with a statin drug. In 1 case the drug appears to have exacerbated underlying myasthenic weakness, whereas in the other 3 cases, de novo antibody formation appears to be most likely. In each case, some degree of recovery followed discontinuation of the statin medication.",2006,3
583,1661260,Small bowel haemorrhage due to cytomegalovirus vasculitis.,A case is described of a life threatening vasculitis of the small bowel leading to massive gastrointestinal haemorrhage which was apparently due to cytomegalovirus inclusion disease. Reactivation of cytomegalovirus probably followed the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis with corticosteroids and azathioprine. This patient was treated successfully by surgical excision of the affected segment of ileum together with intravenous ganciclovir.,1991,11
584,16615675,Chronic hydroxychloroquine use associated with QT prolongation and refractory ventricular arrhythmia.,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is used for treatment of lupus erythematosus. The cardiac toxicity of HCQ has focused primarily on acute intoxication. We report a case of chronic use of HCQ associated with torsade de pointes.
A 67-year-old female presented with acquired long QT interval syndrome with a refractory ventricular arrhythmia. She was receiving chronic therapeutic doses of HCQ for the treatment of lupus erythematosus. Torsades de pointes was diagnosed in the Emergency Department (ED). After excluding other causes of long QT syndrome, the HCQ was suspected as the cause of her ventricular tachycardia. After discontinuing the HCQ, the QT interval was shorter and the patient recovered after treatment with lidocaine and isoproterenol.
The chronic use of HCQ for rheumatic diseases, or as an anti-malarial drug, should be balanced against the risk of developing potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias.",2006,0
585,16620273,Severe acidosis in patients taking metformin--rapid reversal and survival despite high APACHE score.,"Metformin has been shown to reduce complications and mortality from Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is increasingly used to treat this condition. This agent is, however, associated with a rare but serious risk of lactic acidosis.
We present cases of 10 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who developed acute renal failure and severe lactic acidosis. Despite the severity of their illness, all patients but one survived.
The increasing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes and its treatment with metformin might result in more cases of lactic acidosis. However our case report demonstrates that early and aggressive treatment with haemofiltration can improve outcomes even in the presence of severe acidosis.",2006,4
586,16623611,Case report: lack of control of diabetes and weight gain in a patient on initiation and rechallenge of therapy with olanzapine.,"The following is a case report analysis intended to draw attention to the need for better care coordination by describing the observed relationship of olanzapine to metabolic changes manifested as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and weight gain. A 47-year-old male with bipolar I disorder/hallucinations presented to the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) with suicidal ideations. He was referred to the psychiatry service where he was treated with olanzapine. He was followed exclusively by the psychiatry service for more than a year. During that time,weight issues and diabetes status were not addressed. Upon presenting to the primary care service a year and a half later, the patient was taking 40 mg per day of olanzapine and had gained 62 pounds, a 30% increase in body weight; glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) was 11.1%. The patient was enrolled in a weight-loss clinic, and his diabetes medications were adjusted.Subsequently, olanzapine was discontinued because of weight gain and uncontrolled diabetes. Blood sugar and A1c were finally stabilized one month after discontinuation of olanzapine (A1c,6.9%). The patient experienced a relapse in his bipolar disorder,and olanzapine was restarted at 20 to 40 mg per day. His blood sugar became uncontrolled, he gained 13 pounds, and his A1c increased to 9.4%.",2006,4
587,16629074,Traumatic late flap dehiscence and Enterobacter keratitis following LASIK.,"To report a case of traumatic flap dehiscence and Enterobacter keratitis 34 months after LASIK.
A 36-year-old man sustained a flap dehiscence following traumatic right eye gouging by a seagull claw. He presented the following day with uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) in the affected eye of 3/200 and organic foreign body deposits underneath the flap. Systemic and topical antibiotics were administered and urgent surgical debridement and replacement of the LASIK flap was performed. An Enterobacter species was cultured from an intraoperative swab.
After a prolonged postoperative course, including administration of topical ofloxacin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, and dexamethasone, UCVA returned to 20/20.
Good visual outcome after early debridement and appropriate antibiotics was achieved. Patients should be injury advised to seek prompt ophthalmic consultation after LASIK.",2006,4
588,16632429,Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia simulating progression in bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.,"Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a clinicopathologic syndrome with characteristic features. The diagnosis of BOOP requires the presence of a combination of pathological, clinical, and radiological features. We report the case of a lung cancer patient with bronquiloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) presenting with BOOP after chemotherapy with docetaxel and gemcitabine producing severe respiratory insufficiency, and simulating a progression of the tumor.",2006,2
589,16637972,An unusual presentation of spontaneous sub-conjunctival haematoma in a patient receiving warfarin.,"A 65-year-old man on warfarin therapy with a sudden spontaneous onset of sub-conjunctival haematoma associated with bloody tears was assessed in the clinic following a referral from an optometrist. Due to discomfort, diplopia and lagophthalmos, the haematoma necessitated suspension of warfarin therapy and a surgical evacuation. The sub-conjunctival haematoma in a patient receiving warfarin can pose a significant management challenge.",2006,5
590,16641839,Angioedema and maculopapular eruptions associated with carbamazepine administration.,"Cutaneous rashes and eruptions can be caused by many medications, including carbamazepine. The presentation can be varied depending on severity. Cutaneous eruptions occur in 3% of individuals administered carbamazepine. Angioedema, a rare side effect of carbamazepine, involves vascular leakage in dermis and subcutis mediated by immunoglobulin E and/or bradykinins. Angioedema is more common in females and in the third decade of life. We report the case of a 27-year-old Indian woman who developed maculopapular rash and angioedema secondary to carbamazepine administration. The patient responded successfully to withdrawal of the drug and treatment with antihistamines. Due to the potentially life-threatening complications of this condition and the increasing use of anticonvulsants in the treatment of mood disorders, psychiatrists must be aware of the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.",2006,5
591,16678268,Severe adenovirus pneumonia (AVP) following infliximab infusion for the treatment of Crohn's disease.,"We report a case of severe AVP three weeks following the administration of infliximab for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). Since the introduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists, various microbiologic agents have been reported to cause pneumonia following their administration. To our knowledge, AVP following therapy with TNF-alpha antagonists has not been reported in English literature. We present a brief review of the mechanism of action of TNF-alpha antagonists and their ability to predispose to various infections including viral pneumonia by interfering with the immune response.",2007,1
592,16682062,First case of ivermectin-induced severe hepatitis.,"Loiasis, caused by the filarial parasite Loa loa, is endemic in West and Central Africa. Ivermectin has been shown to be an effective treatment of loiasis. We report the case of a 20-year-old woman originally from Cameroon who was infected by the L. loa parasite and developed severe hepatitis, identified 1 month after a single dose of ivermectin. Liver biopsy showed intralobular inflammatory infiltrates, confluent necrosis and apoptosis, compatible with drug-induced liver disease. To our knowledge, this is the first case of ivermectin-induced severe liver disease published in the literature.",2006,8
593,16685112,Gemcitabine-induced rectus abdominus radiation recall.,"Radiation recall has been described in the context of gemcitabine chemotherapy. However, this phenomenon has been largely limited to skin.
We hereby report a case of radiation recall dermatitis and myositis occurring on gemcitabine monotherapy, five months after completing chemoradiation for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Radiation recall resolved spontaneously with withdrawal of gemcitabine.
This is the second case report that describes gemcitabine-induced radiation recall in rectus abdominus muscles after gemcitabine-based radiation therapy. Given the wide use of gemcitabine following chemoradiation for pancreatic cancer, providers should be aware of this potential complication.",2006,5
594,16688722,Sporadic rippling muscle disease unmasked by simvastatin.,"We report a 53-year-old-man who developed rippling muscle disease (RMD) 2 months after starting simvastatin therapy for hypercholesterolemia. He experienced stiffness, myalgias, and classic rippling, which was confirmed on clinical examination. Discontinuation of the statin improved his symptoms. Simvastatin therapy was resumed and resulted in a prompt and severe return of his symptoms. Approximately 1 year after symptom onset he developed mild seropositive oculobulbar myasthenia gravis, which spontaneously remitted after 5 months. We postulate that an immune-mediated disruption of caveolar function was exacerbated by statin exposure. We are unaware of any previous cases of statin-mediated unmasking of RMD.",2006,10
595,16697705,Acute coronary syndrome induced by capecitabine therapy.,"Capecitabine, a new member of the fluoropyrimidine family, is an orally administered drug that delivers fluorouracil (5-FU) selectively to the tumour. Although the cardiotoxicity of 5-FU is well documented, there is little published data about cardiovascular adverse effects of Capecitabine. This case highlights the possible development of acute coronary syndrome as a side effect of Capecitabine therapy.",2006,10
596,16708747,High-flux haemodialysis treatment as treatment for carbamazepine intoxication.,"Acute severe intoxication with carbamazepine is associated with seizures, coma and respiratory depression. Traditionally, charcoal haemoperfusion is used to remove the drug. We present a case of carbamazepine intoxication, successfully treated with three hours of high-flux haemodialysis. Thus, haemodialysis using high-flux membranes is a feasible and effective therapeutic option for carbamazepine intoxication.",2006,3
597,16728538,Drug-induced hepatitis in an acromegalic patient during combined treatment with pegvisomant and octreotide long-acting repeatable attributed to the use of pegvisomant.,"We report on a patient with acromegaly who developed severe drug-induced hepatitis during combined treatment with the long-acting somatostatin-analog octreotide and the GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant. The hepatic enzyme disturbances normalized after discontinuation of pegvisomant. After rechallenge with monotherapy pegvisomant, however, the hepatic enzyme disturbances reappeared within a few weeks, indicating that most likely pegvisomant alone and not the long-acting somatostatin analog or the combination of these two drugs was responsible for this case of drug-induced hepatitis. Clinicians should be aware of this potential severe adverse drug reaction and therefore frequent control of hepatic enzymes is mandatory during treatment with pegvisomant.",2006,6
598,1673494,Liposomal amphotericin B in drug-resistant visceral leishmaniasis.,"The treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) may be complicated by drug toxicity or intolerance, and by drug resistance. Amphotericin B (AmB) is effective, but its use is limited by toxicity: renal impairment, anaemia, fever, malaise, and hypokalaemia are common. Liposomes have been proposed as an effective way to target drugs at macrophages, which are the cells infected in visceral leishmaniasis. In animals AmB incorporated into liposomes is highly effective against experimental leishmaniasis, with low toxicity. This report is of the successful treatment of a patient with multiply drug-resistant visceral leishmaniasis with a commercially prepared formulation of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) ('AmBisome', Vestar, San Dimas, California, USA). We also report, for comparison, a patient treated with conventional AmB, and preliminary studies in mice comparing the two agents.",1991,5
599,16757971,"Listeria brain abscess, Pneumocystis pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma after temozolomide.","A 55-year-old man with glioblastoma multiforme was treated with continuous, dose-dense temozolomide. This therapy was curtailed after three cycles because of nausea, asthenia, and neuropsychological deterioration. During a subsequent course of radiotherapy, the patient developed fever, headaches, and cutaneous lesions.
Physical examination, cerebral MRI, brain biopsy, skin biopsy, immunohistochemistry, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, and laboratory tests.
Severe temozolomide-induced immunosuppression, exacerbated by corticosteroids, with profound T-cell lymphocytopenia and simultaneous opportunistic infections with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, brain abscess with Listeria monocytogenes, and cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma.
Discontinuation of temozolomide, discontinuation of radiotherapy, antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin and gentamicin, and administration of atovaquone and pentamidine.",2006,6
600,16765687,Rapid resolution of topiramate-induced angle-closure glaucoma with methylprednisolone and mannitol.,"Topiramate-induced angle-closure glaucoma (TiACG) is believed to be related to its sulfonamide moiety. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, the time course and constellation of symptoms are consistent with a possible inflammatory pathophysiologic condition.
Interventional case report.
We report the clinical outcome of a case of TiACG that was associated with an extreme intraocular pressure elevation of >60 mm Hg that was treated with the combination of systemic mannitol and methylprednisolone.
The combination of the two systemic medications resulted in the resolution of the attack with a much more rapid time course than is seen typically for extreme cases of TiACG. Mannitol treatment alone did not lower the intraocular pressure after 90 minutes, although improvement was noted four hours after methylprednisolone.
For severe cases of TiACG that are associated with very high intraocular pressures, the combination of mannitol and methylprednisolone can induce a rapid improvement. Inflammation may be a component of TiACG.",2006,6
601,16767537,Spontaneous splenic infarction associated with sumatriptan use.,"Triptans are specific agonists of the serotonergic 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors that have increasingly been used in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches. Though they are generally considered safe, there have been a few reports of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with triptan use. We report a patient who developed spontaneous splenic infarction after the use of sumatriptan for the treatment of migraine headache.",2006,9
602,16791713,Acute myocardial infarction during high-dose methylprednisolone therapy for Graves' ophthalmopathy.,"Management of Graves' ophthalmopathy includes high-dose glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids may have many side effects, and therefore their use should always be carefully considered. Here we present the case of a woman who received high doses of methylprednisolone (1 g iv daily) for active Graves' ophthalmopathy, and developed severe hypertension followed by myocardial infarction on the fifth day of treatment. Before the myocardial infarction, the patient was in good condition, normotensive, non-diabetic, non-obese. Except hypothyroidism after radioiodine treatment (euthyroid under substitutional therapy), she suffered from no other diseases. There had been one episode of chest discomfort in her past history. We conclude that myocardial infarction may develop in patients treated with high-dose glucocorticoids for Graves' ophthalmopathy, and increased blood pressure may herald this complication.",2006,4
603,1680596,Psoriasis-like skin reaction in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis after sulphasalazine therapy.,"Presented is a case story of a woman with classical rheumatoid arthritis, who during introduction of sulphasalazine (SASP) therapy developed a severe and lasting psoriasis-like skin reaction.",1991,6
604,16816519,Vincristine induced cranial polyneuropathy.,"We describe a 5-year-old girl showed recovery of vincristine induced cranial polyneuropathy with pyridoxine and pyridostigmine treatment. A 5-year-old girl was diagnosed preB cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). She received chemotherapy according to the previously described modified St. Jude total therapy studies XIII. Five days after the fourth dose of vincristine, she presented with bilateral ptosis. Neurological examination revealed bilateral ptosis, and complete external opthalmoplegia with normal pupillary and corneal reflexes. She received 3.8 mg cumulative dose of vincristin before development of ptosis. A neuroprotective and neuroregenerative treatment attempt with pyridoxine and pyridostigmine was initiated. The bilateral ptosis markedly improved after 7 days of pyridoxine and pyridostigmine treatment and completely resolved after two weeks. The both agents were given for 3 weeks and were well tolerated without any side effects. During the follow up period we did not observe residue or recurrence of the ptosis.",2006,6

606,16854757,Cutaneous adverse effects during therapy with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor.,"The use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors for the treatment of solid tumours is now increasing. Cutaneous side effects, namely acneiform eruption, xerosis, telangiectasia, hyperpigmentation, fissures, hair and nail changes, are reported in literature. We describe a case of a man treated with an EGFR-inhibitor (erlotinib) for a cell lung cancer who developed skin manifestations localized in an uncommon area and with an atypical evolution.",2006,0
607,16863495,Olanzapine-associated neuroleptic malignant syndrome.,"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but potentially serious complication of neuroleptic drugs. It may vary in both presenting characteristics and severity. Several different criteria for diagnosis exist, and each differs from the others slightly. We describe a 66-year-old woman with chronic paranoid schizophrenia who was prescribed olanzapine along with several other psychiatric drugs and an antihypertensive drug. The patient displayed several characteristics of NMS during therapy with olanzapine, including fever, elevated creatine kinase level, leukocytosis, and mild muscle rigidity. When olanzapine was held, the signs and symptoms improved and then returned with rechallenge of olanzapine. For this reason, olanzapine was considered strongly associated with this patient's apparent NMS episode. The patient's beta-blocker therapy may have masked additional signs of NMS. In addition, the patient tolerated other neuroleptics that were started in the hospital after the suspected NMS episode. The variation among different diagnostic criteria makes this syndrome a challenging diagnosis at times, in particular when atypical antipsychotics are suspected as the causative agent.",2006,8
608,16882109,Allergic contact angioedema to benzoyl peroxide.,"Benzoyl peroxide (BP) is commonly used for topical acne treatment and has long been known to be a weak allergen and a strong irritant. We report a case of a 26-year-old woman, who presented with an itchy erythematous reaction and strong oedema localized to the face. Two weeks before angioedema, the patient had started a new topical treatment with a gel containing 10% BP for acne. She was patch tested to European Standard Series, including BP 1% in white petrolatum, and to the 10% BP-containing gel previously used by herself, showing positivity on day 2 to BP 1% and to the 10% BP-containing gel. Factors that suggested an association between the severe angioedematous reaction and BP topical application include the strong reaction to BP in the patch-test, the temporal relationship, the complete resolution of symptoms after the drug was withdrawn and the absence of other identified explanations.",2006,8
609,16884425,Reversible findings of restricted diffusion in 5-fluorouracil neurotoxicity.,"A 35-year-old woman presented with neurotoxicity correlated to an i.v. regimen of 5-fluorouracil as episodes of acute confusional state and abnormalities of symmetrically restricted diffusion in the periventricular white matter and corpus callosum. On discontinuing the medication, the areas of severely restricted diffusion had entirely resolved, with minimal residual T2 signal abnormality. In this case, immediate discontinuation of the chemotherapeutic agent apparently reversed the patient's symptoms and findings on MRI. The scant information available in the published literature regarding this phenomenon is reviewed with regard to 5-fluorouracil.",2006,8
610,1688693,Treatment of caffeine toxicity with esmolol.,"We present the case of a 58-year-old woman who ingested more than 35 g of caffeine in a suicide attempt. She manifested all the clinical symptoms and signs of caffeine toxicity. Esmolol, an ultrashort-acting beta 1-selective antagonist, controlled her multiple dysrhythmias and symptoms of sympathetic nervous system hyperstimulation. We suggest the use of esmolol for treatment of dysrhythmias secondary to caffeine toxicity; to the best of our knowledge, the use of esmolol has not been reported for this purpose.",1990,1
611,16889287,Severe dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome.,"Dapsone, a potent antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory compound, is mainly used in the treatment of leprosy and a variety of blistering skin diseases. It may cause a severe adverse drug reaction with multiorgan involvement known as dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome. We report the case of a 21-year-old female patient with dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome. The clinical presentation mimicked a viral exanthema.",2006,0
612,16901609,Anaphylaxis to intrathecal diamorphine.,"A 42-year-old male underwent a total hip arthroplasty under subarachnoid anaesthesia with intrathecal bupivacaine and diamorphine. Shortly after the start of surgery, he suffered an allergic reaction that, at first, was difficult to distinguish from the recognised side-effects of intrathecal diamorphine. Once the diagnosis was made, he was treated with adrenaline and made a full recovery. The serum concentration of mast cell tryptase approximately 1.5h after the onset of the adverse incident confirmed an anaphylactic reaction. Skin prick testing several weeks later identified diamorphine as the likely causative agent, a drug overlooked initially as a potential cause. We believe this is the first report of intrathecal diamorphine causing anaphylaxis.",2006,9
613,16914372,Systemic allergic reactions to aprotinin injection around the Achilles tendon.,"Local aprotinin injections are used in the treatment of chronic tendinopathy. Severe allergic reactions, although uncommon, have been reported. We highlight two instances of systemic allergic reaction, and discuss the potential side effects of local aprotinin injections in the orthopaedic setting as well as the evidence base for its use.",2007,10
614,16923659,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome in the critical care setting: case analysis.,"Serotonin syndrome (SS) and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) are medical emergencies associated with psychotropic administration. Differentiation and treatment can be complex, especially when features of both syndromes are present and the patient has taken both serotonergic and neuroleptic agents.
Case analysis of a poly-drug overdose (venlafaxine, topiramate, divalproex sodium, risperidone, and carbamazepine) presenting with mixed SS/NMS features and whose clinical management suggests a practical algorithm for treatment of undifferentiated SS/NMS in critical care settings.
The suggested algorithm includes: 1) Supportive care and withdrawal of all potentially offending agents; 2) Laboratory evaluation with prompt initiation of treatment for both disorders--cyproheptadine for SS and dantrolene for NMS; 3) Do not use bromocriptine (contraindicated in SS) or chlorpromazine (contraindicated in NMS) initially; 4) Add bromocriptine when clinical presentation becomes consistent with NMS (SS can be prolonged if serotonergic agent has long half-life).
Prompt and appropriate identification and intervention are essential for successful management of SS and NMS. The suggested treatment algorithm allows for specific treatment of both disorders and avoids potentially exacerbating either one. The algorithm derived from this case could serve as both a practical guideline and impetus for further investigation in light of increasing psychotropic co-administration.",0,0
615,16935446,Phenytoin desensitization in a child with symptomatic localization-related epilepsy.,"We reported a child with refractory partial seizures successfully managed by clinical desensitization to phenytoin. The patient had ischemic brain lesions due to cardiopulmonary arrest at 39 weeks of corrected age. He had complex partial seizures refractory to several antiepileptic drugs since 4 years of age. At 8 years 1 month of age, phenytoin was first administered. Fever and maculopapular rashes appeared at 10 days after phenytoin initiation, and then the drug was discontinued. At 8 years 8 months of age, desensitization was attempted because of refractoriness of seizures to drugs other than phenytoin. Desensitization was started at 1mg daily, and then the dose was doubled every week. His seizures were controlled by 150mg/day of phenytoin in combination with primidone. No problems have been observed during desensitization.",2007,3
616,16939867,Localized purpura associated with lamotrigine.,"Antiepileptic drug hypersensitivity syndrome consists of fever, rash, and internal organ involvement and usually occurs within the first 2 months of initiation of therapy. This report describes a 13-year-old female with a right frontal high-grade glioma and complex partial seizures who developed localized purpura after 23 months of lamotrigine monotherapy. This case study is the second report of localized purpura after prolonged lamotrigine treatment suggesting this may be an atypical lamotrigine-induced drug reaction.",2006,9
617,16945058,Acute renal failure during lisinopril and losartan therapy for proteinuria.,"The use of combined therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) for treatment of proteinuria has been gaining support. Limited data are available regarding this treatment in the pediatric population. This report describes a case of acute compromise of renal function associated with hypotension in a 7-year-old boy treated with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril and the ARB losartan. It emphasizes the need for close surveillance of renal function and blood pressure during such therapy even in patients with relative preservation of renal function. Further investigation into the utility and safety of dual therapy with an ACE inhibitor plus an ARB in pediatric patients is warranted. Key Words: renal failure, proteinuria, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ACEI, angiotensin II receptor blocker, ARB.",2006,9

He developed an inferior corneal epithelial defect and, later, a well-demarcated area of inferior corneal keratinization. Since the corneal keratinization clinically improved with conservative management, surgical intervention was not required.",1990,4
619,16948177,Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia after rituximab therapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.,"Rituximab is a chimeric, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody initially approved for relapsed, refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and is being applied in an increasing variety of clinical scenarios. Most adverse events are due to an infusion-related symptom complex, and severe pulmonary complications are rare. We describe a case of an NHL patient who received rituximab and developed symptomatic, biopsy-proven multinodular bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP). This is the first reported case of BOOP associated with single-agent rituximab, and along with two other patients we describe, as well as two prior reports of BOOP in NHL patients receiving rituximab-based combinations, strengthens the possibility of a causal relationship. Moreover, these findings suggest that the incidence of BOOP following rituximab therapy may be higher than has been previously appreciated. Physicians utilizing rituximab should be aware of this association given the difficulty of differentiating between presentations of BOOP and neoplastic pulmonary processes.",2006,12
620,16960880,Lower extremity arterial thrombosis following sonographically guided thrombin injection of a femoral pseudoaneurysm.,"Sonographically guided percutaneous thrombin injection is a minimally invasive and highly successful treatment of arterial pseudoaneurysms. Despite a very low complication rate, several severe arterial thrombotic events have been reported following thrombin injection of pseudoaneurysms. Native arterial thrombosis, though recognized as a severe complication of thrombin injection, has not been well described in the literature. We report a case of successful surgical management of arterial thrombosis after percutaneous thrombin injection of a femoral artery pseudoaneurysm in a 69-year-old woman. The pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment options for this complication are discussed.",2007,2
621,16968538,Hemolytic uremic syndrome following the infusion of oxaliplatin: case report.,"Oxaliplatin is a platinum derivative, which is used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. A small number of oxaliplatin-related hemolytic and/or thrombocytopenic reactions have been reported. We present a case of hemolytic-uremic syndrome that developed during the 4th cycle of combination chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin.
A 52-year-old-male was administered chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin for a Duke's stage C colorectal carcinoma. Three cycles of chemotherapy had been administered without complications when, at the beginning of the fourth cycle, the patient developed clinical and laboratory abnormalities consistent with the development of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Treatment was discontinued; the patient was managed with monitored IV hydration and loop diuretics, high dose corticosteroids and fresh frozen plasma infusions and recovered completely.
The hemolytic-uremic syndrome may be a rare complication of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Clinicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion to diagnose and treat this life-threatening adverse event.",2006,9
622,16978752,Fatal agranulocytosis: the use of olanzapine in a patient with schizophrenia and myelodysplasia.,"Neutropenia and agranulocytosis are risks known to occur with phenothiazines and clozapine. The mechanisms responsible for these conditions currently remain unclear. To our knowledge, no case of fatal agranulocytosis as a result of olanzapine treatment was reported in the literature. Thus any case of severe neutropenia occurring in a patient receiving olanzapine is alarming to clinicians. First, a review of the literature produced 41 anecdotic cases of neutropenia or agranulocytosis during treatment with olanzapine (Zyprexa) reported in a total of 24 publications. Second, we report a case of neutropenia, which proved to be fatal in a schizophrenia patient receiving olanzapine and thiazide. The cause of the death was Myelodysplastic syndrome. There is not enough evidence to prove the involvement of either olanzapine or hydrochlorothiazide or the interaction between them in this patient's myelodysplasia. Bone marrow cytogenetic study confirmed the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11, as reported in myeloid leukemia. If this patient would have died suddenly without the laboratory investigations that lead to the diagnosis of myeloblastic leukemia, the cause would have been probably and wrongfully allotted to treatment with olanzapine.",2007,1
623,16986159,Camptocormia induced by atypical antipsychotics and resolved by electroconvulsive therapy.,"We present a depressive patient who developed mild parkinsonian signs and camptocormia after the introduction of olanzapine. She had been treated before with other antipsychotic drugs. When camptocormia was diagnosed, olanzapine was withdrawn and levodopa was introduced. Depressive symptoms got worse and electroconvulsive therapy was tried. When the treatment was completed, her depression substantially improved and her posture became completely upright.",2006,11
624,16997047,Recurrent hyponatremia associated with citalopram and mirtazapine.,"Depression is a common problem in elderly patients and frequently is treated with antidepressants. We present the case of a 67-year-old depressed woman who began treatment with citalopram. Two months later, hyponatremia was diagnosed, most likely syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. After discontinuation of citalopram therapy, serum sodium concentrations normalized. Later, she began treatment with mirtazapine. Five months after initiating mirtazapine therapy, she developed symptomatic hyponatremia. After mirtazapine therapy was discontinued, serum sodium concentrations normalized. In this case, unlike those previously reported, hyponatremia recurred 5 months after switching from citalopram to mirtazapine, which is believed to be a safe antidepressant. In conclusion, patients older than 60 years should have baseline electrolyte measurements before starting therapy with an antidepressant, and these should be monitored not only in the first weeks of treatment, but throughout the full course.",2006,10
625,17009081,Nephrotic syndrome associated with interferon-beta-1b therapy for multiple sclerosis.,"A 43-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis (MS) had nephrotic syndrome 21 months after starting treatment with interferon (IFN)-beta-1b (subcutaneous administration). She had taken no drug except for the IFN-beta-1b. Because nephrotic syndrome may be induced by IFN therapy, the IFN was stopped. Percutaneous renal biopsy revealed that she had minimal change nephrotic syndrome. As nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and general edema were worsening even 2 weeks after cessation of the drug, oral corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone 40 mg/day) was started. The nephrotic syndrome was treated successfully with prednisolone. The dosage of prednisolone was tapered, without a relapse, and then the corticosteroid therapy was stopped. IFN-beta-1b therapy was then resumed, and the patient is in remission for both nephrotic syndrome and MS. Though proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome is a rare adverse effect of IFN-beta-1b therapy, physicians treating MS patients with this agent should pay careful attention to new clinical symptoms and laboratory findings.",2006,9
626,17016002,"Acute eosinophilic pneumonia caused by calcium stearate, an additive agent for an oral antihistaminic medication.","A 70-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of dyspnea after taking an antihistaminic agent (homochlorcyclizine hydrochloride) for itching. Chest roentgenogram showed infiltration in the left lung field, and laboratory data revealed eosinophilia. Examination of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed an increased eosinophil count. A drug lymphocyte stimulation test was positive only for calcium stearate, an additive contained in the homochlorcyclizine hydrochloride tablet. The pulmonary infiltration and clinical symptoms subsided after withdrawal of all drugs and initiation of glucocorticoid therapy. Therefore, we concluded that this patient's pulmonary disease was caused by calcium stearate, an additive for an antihistaminic drug. An allergic reaction to a drug's additive material should be considered as a rare cause of drug-induced acute eosinophilic pneumonia.",2006,0
627,17026827,Scleritis complicating zoledronic acid infusion.,"We present a case of severe unilateral posterior scleritis associated with zoledronic acid administration that was recognized and treated in a timely manner. Subsequent use of pamidronate was associated with milder inflammation in the same eye that eventually resolved with continued monthly infusions, indicating the possibility of immunologic tolerance. Physicians prescribing these drugs should be aware of this side effect, which, if not recognized and treated appropriately, is potentially devastating. We review the published data as well as the current treatment recommendations.",2006,9
628,17034541,Late lethal hepatitis B virus reactivation after rituximab treatment of low-grade cutaneous B-cell lymphoma.,"The chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, is a promising treatment for cutaneous B-cell lymphomas. Classically used in combination with a multiagent-chemotherapy regimen, it can sometimes give excellent results alone. Because of its selective action on B lymphocytes, it is considered a moderate immunosuppressant in terms of infection. We describe a woman with relapsed cutaneous follicular centre B-cell lymphoma and secondary lymph-node involvement treated with rituximab alone, which induced a complete remission. One year later, she experienced a fatal hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation. Several such HBV reactivations were reported after combined rituximab and multiagent chemotherapy for B-cell lymphomas. This is the first case of HBV reactivation occurring during the year following rituximab monotherapy in the absence of any other immunosuppressive factor.",2006,11
629,1703754,Cryptococcal meningitis in a child with systemic lupus erythematosus.,This is a case report of fatal cryptococcal meningitis in a child with systemic lupus erythematosus being treated with prednisolone and azathioprine. It is believed to be the first case of cryptococcal meningitis recorded in a child in Saudi Arabia.,1990,0
630,17039658,An intertrigo-like eruption from pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.,"Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of solid tumors. It has a considerably lower risk of cardiotoxicity than its parent compound, doxorubicin. PLD also has a different cutaneous side effect profile than doxorubicin, and its cutaneous toxicity can be dose limiting. We report the case of a 60-year-old woman who developed erythema and erosions in the axilla and groin while on PLD for breast cancer. Nystatin was ineffective. Biopsies revealed an interface dermatitis with epidermal dysmaturation. Bland emollients and reduction in the dose of PLD resulted in resolution of the eruption. An intertriginous eruption with histological features of epidermal dysmaturation and an interface dermatitis has been previously reported in the dermatopathology literature. This eruption appears to be a distinct cutaneous toxicity of PLD.",2006,10
631,17044380,Warfarin-induced skin necrosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia following mitral valve replacement for marantic endocarditis.,Hemostatic physiology involves a complex interlinking of blood and endothelial factors. Its pharmacological manipulation invariably impacts at multiple molecular sites. Herein is reported an unusual case of coexistent warfarin-induced skin necrosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia following mitral valve replacement for thromboembolic phenomena associated with marantic endocarditis and bronchial adenocarcinoma. Thrombophilia in the face of endocarditis should be treated with a suspicion of underlying cancer.,2006,9
632,17060191,Premature closure of the ductus arteriosus: variable response among monozygotic twins after in utero exposure to indomethacin.,"Exposure of the fetus to indomethacin by administration of the drug to the mother may cause many side effects, including premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Hypoxia is a predisposing factor for premature ductal closure and often occurs after maternal indomethacin therapy. We present two sets of monozygotic twins with twin-to-twin transfusion, where in utero ductal closure occurred in the donor twin while the recipient twin appeared unaffected. This selective closure of the ductus arteriosus suggests that the affected twin was predisposed to hypoxia and thus was more susceptible to ductal closure in response to indomethacin exposure.",0,0
633,17068466,Severe corneal toxicity after topical fluoroquinolone therapy: report of two cases.,"To describe 2 cases of sterile corneal ulcers that persisted after several weeks of therapy with topical moxifloxacin 0.5% but that resolved when antibiotic therapy was changed.
Small case series.
Both cases presented here describe corneal ulcers that persisted and showed signs of worsening during weeks of frequent topical dosing with moxifloxacin. Descemet folds and an atypically large amount of stromal edema were present in both cases, and there appeared to be possible endothelial dysfunction as well. There was no sign of bacterial, viral, or fungal infection in either case. In both cases, healing began a few days after moxifloxacin was discontinued, and topical gatifloxacin and corticosteroids were initiated.
These cases suggest that moxifloxacin may interfere with the healing of corneal ulcers.",2006,8
634,17083900,Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis induced by nimesulide.,"Nimesulide is a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug with antipyretic and analgesic properties. Because of its favorable tolerability profile it appears to be a preferred alternative, especially in NSAID-sensitive patients. We report a case of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) in a 50-year-old woman that was attributed to the ingestion of nimesulide. To the best of our knowledge there have been no previous reports of AGEP induced by the ingestion of nimesulide in the medical literature. Nimesulide should be added to the list of agents associated with this serious adverse drug reaction.",2006,10
635,17090724,Acute amphotericin B overdose.,"To report the clinical course of a woman with cryptococcal meningitis and no previous cardiac disease who developed a fatal cardiac arrhythmia after an acute overdose of amphotericin B and to review its toxicity.
A 41-year-old woman with a history of proliferative glomerulonephritis from systemic lupus erythematosus was admitted with a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis. Liposomal amphotericin B was prescribed at the standard dose of 5 mg/kg/day; however, amphotericin B deoxycholate 5 mg/kg was inadvertently administered (usual dose of the deoxycholate formulation is 0.5-0.8 mg/kg/day). The patient developed cardiac arrhythmias, acute renal failure, and anemia. The medication error was noticed after she had received 2 doses of amphotericin B deoxycholate, and it was then discontinued. Despite treatment in the intensive care unit, the woman died on the sixth day after admission.
Amphotericin B deoxycholate has been reported to produce significant cardiac toxicity, with ventricular arrhythmias and bradycardia reported in overdoses in children and in adults with preexisting cardiac disease, even when administered in conventional dosages and infusion rates. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a highly probable relationship between the observed cardiac toxicity and amphotericin B deoxycholate therapy in this patient.
Given the fulminant course of amphotericin B deoxycholate overdosage and lack of effective therapy, stringent safeguards against its improper administration should be in place.",2006,12
636,17109650,Valvular heart disease in a patient taking benfluorex.,"The authors describe a case of valvular heart disease in a 48-year-old woman receiving benfluorex (150 mg t.i.d. for 8 years) and leading to surgical mitral valve replacement. Examination showed severe dyspnea with severe mitral regurgitation associated with tricuspid regurgitation. No other common disease known to affect mitral valves nor intake of other drugs (ergot derivatives or appetite suppressant drugs) was found. The paper discusses the imputability of benfluorex, a drug used as an adjuvant in hypercholesterolemia, structurally related to amphetamines.",2006,12
637,1711090,Trans-catheter hepatic arterial injection of lipiodol soluble anti-cancer agent SMANCS and ADR suspension in lipiodol combined with arterial embolization and local hyperthermia for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"The clinical effect and safety of Lp-TAE alone and combined with radiofrequency (RF) capacitive hyperthermia (HT) were evaluated in 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with cirrhosis of the liver. After the oily carcinostatic agents were administered by Lp-TAE, HT, at a temperature of greater than 42.5 degrees C, was induced for 40 min, twice a week by an RF of 8 MHz for a total of 10 to 38 times. The response rate was 40% in the 10 cases that were treated with Lp-TAE combined with HT and 20% in the 10 cases that were treated with Lp-TAE. The patients who were treated with Lp-TAE combined with HT had a tendency to have better survival rates than those of the Lp-TAE group (p less than 0.099). The main side-effects of Lp-TAE combined with HT were low-grade fever, localized pain, myelo-suppression and liver dysfunction, but these were transient and eventually disappeared.",0,0
638,17123120,Tacrolimus-induced HUS: an unusual cause of acute renal failure in nephrotic syndrome.,"Acute renal failure (ARF) is an uncommon complication in children with nephrotic syndrome. We report here the case of a 10-year-old male child with primary steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome who was non-responsive to steroids and cyclophosphamide. A kidney biopsy revealed that he had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. His treatment was initiated with tacrolimus (dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day) in two divided doses along with prednisolone 60 mg/m(2)/daily. After 1 month of treatment, he was diagnosed as having acute renal failure secondary to HUS. This was postulated to be due to the tacrolimus therapy, which was withdrawn. Two weeks after stopping the adminsitration of tacrolimus, his urine output improved, and the hemoglobin and serum creatinine normalized. Thus, tacrolimus-induced HUS is a rare cause of ARF in nephrotic syndrome. With the increasing use of tacrolimus in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, the treating physicians need to be aware of this rare, but potentially life-threatening side effect.",2007,2
639,17133571,Liver transplantation for fulminant hepatitis related to nevirapine therapy.,Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is an important cause of hepatocellular injury. Non-nucleoside retroviral transcriptase inhibitors are known to cause hepatotoxicity. We describe a detailed case of fulminant hepatitis induced by nevirapine (Viramune) and treated by liver transplantation.,2006,12
640,17163271,Cholelithiasis and thrombosis of the central retinal vein in a renal transplant recipient treated with cyclosporin.,"The use of cyclosporin has been associated with the development of cholelithiasis in transplant recipients. Cholelithiasis in turn enhances the effects of cyclosporin on increased platelet aggregation. In this report, a patient who had undergone a renal transplantation as a result of malignant hypertension, and who was on immunosuppressive therapy consisting of cyclosporin, prednisone and azathioprine, developed thrombosis of the central retinal vein 5 years following the transplantation. Seven years after the transplantation, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholangitis and subsequently secondary chronic biliary sclerosis were detected. Latero-lateral anastomosis between the common bile duct and duodenum was performed during explorative laparotomy and ursodeoxycholic acid treatment was introduced. The possible inter-relationship of the cholestatis, central retinal vein thrombosis and immunosuppression are discussed.",2006,0
641,17167851,Hepatotoxicity induced by cyproterone acetate: a report of three cases.,"Cyproterone acetate (CPA) is a steroidal synthetic progestagen and anti-androgenic compound widely administered in prostate cancer which has been evidentially correlated with a severe hepatotoxic potency. Three male patients aged 78-83 years are presented, in whom severe hepatotoxic reactions emerged after CPA administration. Patients were treated with CPA at the doses of 200-300 mg/d for malignant prostate disease for 3-12 mo prior to the acute manifestation of the hepatic disease. Clinical features compatible with mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic liver disease including jaundice, white stools and dark urine, manifested in all three cases whereas encephalopathy and ascites were present in two of the patients. Other primary causes of hepatotoxicity (alcohol consumption and viral hepatitis) were also verified in two cases, and in those patients biopsy findings revealed the presence of cirrhotic lesions in liver parenchyma. Discontinuation of the therapeutic agent led to the amelioration of the clinical profile in all the patients whereas a patient died 40 d after hospital admission due to sepsis, despite acute liver disease improvement. The current article highlights the hepatotoxic potency of a widely administered therapeutic agent and illustrates the importance of clinical surveillance especially in patients with previous hepatic diseases. Three relevant cases are reported and a review of the published literature is made.",2006,12
642,17176478,Leishmania infantum leishmaniasis in corticosteroid--treated patients.,"The number of leishmaniasis cases associated with immunosuppression has increased regularly over the past 20 years. Immunosuppression related to HIV infection, immunosuppressive treatment, organ transplantation, and neoplastic diseases increases the risk for Leishmania-infected people to develop visceral illness.
Three cases of Leishmania infantum leishmaniasis in corticosteroid (CS)-treated patients are reported: an isolated lingual leishmaniasis in a farmer treated with CS for asthma, a severe visceral leishmaniasis associated with cutaneous lesions in a woman with myasthenia gravis, and a visceral involvement after cutaneous leishmaniasis in a man receiving CS.
Physicians should recognise CS-treated patients as a population likely to be immune-suppressed. In immunodeficiency conditions, unusual forms of leishmaniasis can develop and foster the risk of a diagnostic delay and of poor response to therapy.",2006,12
643,17182354,Methylphenidate (Ritalin)-associated cataract and glaucoma.,"Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Ritalin) is the drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, an association of Ritalin with glaucoma has been reported. We report a case of Ritalin-associated cataract and glaucoma. A 10-year-old boy was diagnosed with ADHD and had received methylphenidate hydrochloride, 60 mg/day for 2 years. He presented with blurred vision. Best-corrected visual acuity was 6/60 in both eyes. Ocular examinations revealed intraocular pressure (IOP) of 30 mmHg under medication, dense posterior subcapsular opacity of lens, pale disc with advanced cupping, and marked constriction of visual field. Despite maximal anti-glaucomatous medication, IOP still could not be controlled. The patient then received combined cataract and glaucoma surgery. Visual acuity improved and IOP was within normal limits in both eyes postoperatively. Large dose of methylphenidate may cause cataract and glaucoma. The mechanism remains unclear. Doctors should be aware of the possible ocular side effects of methylphenidate.",2006,12
644,17188061,Visual hallucinations after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab in vascular age-related macular degeneration.,"To describe transient structured visual hallucinations in a patient with vascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), following an intravitreal Avastin-injection.
Interventional case reports.
A fully alert 83-year-old woman with disciform scar right eye (OD) and occult choroidal neovascularization (CNV) left eye (OS) experienced a progressive visual loss to 20/800 OD and 20/400 OS. A coherent 84-year-old woman with occult CNV both eyes (OU) experienced decreased vision of 20/800 OU. After both patients gave informed consent, an uneventful intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg Avastin was performed in the left eyes.
One day and three days after an uneventful intravitreal injection both patients experienced structured hallucinations including trees, faces, and water for approximately 15 to 30 minutes.
We report a typical symptoms of Charles-Bonnet syndrome (CBS) in patients with severe AMD after intravitreal Avastin-injections. The reduced retinal edema and realignment of the photoreceptors may promote the release phenomenon and trigger hallucinatory episodes.",2007,1
645,17195428,A case of metoclopramide-induced oculogyric crisis in a 16-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis.,"Oculogyric crisis is a neurologic reaction characterized by bilateral dystonic elevation of visual gaze as well as hyperextension of the neck. This reaction is most commonly explained as an adverse effect of numerous medications, such as dopamine receptor blocking agents or neuroleptic medications and traditional antipsychotic or antiemetic drugs, such as prochlorperazine or metoclopramide. A case of oculogyric crisis induced by metoclopramide is described in this paper.",2006,11
646,17199845,Mycophenolate mofetil substitution for cyclosporine-dependent myasthenia gravis and nephrotoxicity.,"Severe autoimmune myasthenia gravis is difficult to manage and may require immunosuppression with cyclosporine. However, cyclosporine dependency is associated with the risk of nephrotoxicity. Mycophenolate mofetil is a non-nephrotoxic alternative which should be considered to rescue cyclosporine-dependent, severe myasthenia gravis sufferers with renal impairment from progression to end-stage renal failure. However, the evidence is limited and studies have not assessed the outcome of a direct substitution in these cyclosporine-dependent patients. We study three such patients who successfully converted to mycophenolate mofetil, and briefly examine the evidence behind this option. We believe that total cyclosporine withdrawal is feasible, but strongly recommend overlapping mycophenolate mofetil treatment with cyclosporine.",2007,1
647,17205927,"Auto-intoxication with flecainide and quinapril: ECG-changes, symptoms and treatment.","Flecainide acetate is a sodium channel blocker and a class Ic antiarrhythmic agent with potential life-threatening proarrhythmic and cardioinhibitory properties when taken in overdose. Quinapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-inhibitor) and overdose can lead to prolonged hypotension and, less frequently, transient renal impairment. We describe the first published case of intoxication with both drugs. The patient developed a broad-QRS-tachycardia and severe hypotension. Treatment with volume expansion, hypertonic sodium bicarbonate, inotropic support with norepinephrine and insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump led to complete recovery after 72 hours. We assume that the clinical picture was mainly dictated by flecainide intoxication. Relevant literature data are discussed.",2006,12
648,172214,Cardiomyopathy after widely separated courses of adriamycin exacerbated by actinomycin-D and mithramycin.,"A 22-year-old man with a synovial cell sarcoma attained an excellent response to therapy with adriamycin (NSC-123127) and dimethyltriazeno imidazole carboxamide (NSC-45388). Therapy was discontinued at a cumulative dose of adriamycin of 600 mg/m2. Relapse occurred 13 1/2 months later, and therapy with adriamycin was restarted. Because of tumor progression, therapy was discontinued after a cumulative dose of adriamycin of 120 mg/m2. Ten weeks later, severe congestive heart failure developed which ultimately caused the patient's death. Exacerbations of the heart failure were temporally related to the administration of the antitumor antibiotics actinomycin-D (NSC-3053) and mithramycin (NSC-24559). Electron microscopic examination of the heart revealed changes characteristic of adriamycin cardiomyopathy. Thus, even after a long hiatus, it may not be safe to exceed the recommended maximum cumulative dose level of adriamycin. The pathogenic mechanisms involved in the development of adriamycin cardiomyopathy are reviewed, and the possible synergistic effect of other antitumor antibiotics is discussed.",1975,11
649,17224428,Drug-induced pericarditis mimicking Brugada syndrome.,"Brugada syndrome (BS) is associated with sudden cardiac death in patients with a structurally normal heart. The ECG pattern of BS has also been described in patients with myocardial abnormalities. Cardiac hypersensitivity and myopericarditis have been reported during long-term treatment with mesalazine. We report the case of a man, treated with mesalazine for Crohn's disease who developed drug-induced pericarditis. The ECG showed a coved ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads V1-V3, a pattern mimicking BS. The ECG normalized in a few days after mesalazine withdrawal and the follow-up was uneventful. The ECG remained normal. Two ajmaline tests were both negative and ruled out the diagnosis of BS. This observation illustrates that a coved ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads should not be, systematically, regarded as a marker of a specific syndrome, but may also reflect a common electrical manifestation of abnormalities in the right ventricle or pericardium.",2007,1
650,17228132,Acute drug induced hepatitis due to erlotinib.,"Acute drug induced hepatitis has not been commonly associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Hepatotoxicity seen with erlotinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor to EGFR, is usually transient with mild elevation of transaminases.
We report a case of acute severe hepatitis resulting from erlotinib monotherapy in a patient with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Hepatotoxicity resolved once erlotinib was discontinued and serum transaminases returned to baseline normal values.
Acute severe hepatitis though rare is occasionally observed with EGFR inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib. As EGFR inhibitors are now incorporated with chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic cancers, clinicians should be aware of this potential complication.",2007,1
651,1722991,Usefulness of antiplatelet drugs in the management of heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis.,"Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis is a severe complication of systemic heparin therapy. Its treatment is mainly based upon discontinuation of heparin therapy. However in some patients requiring emergency cardiac or vascular surgery, reexposure to heparin may be unavoidable. We report the management of two such patients by use of antiplatelet drugs for a vascular procedure. In the two cases, a combination of iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analogue (1 to 2 ng/kg/mn) with aspirin and dipyridamole was shown to inhibit ex vivo the heparin-induced platelet aggregation. These antiplatelet agents were continued during the perioperative period. A successful vascular procedure was achieved with full heparinization without subsequent thrombocytopenia or thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. This experience supports the hypothesis that heparin can be readministered early to patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, provided antiplatelet therapy is given.",1991,11
652,17241588,Cutaneous reaction to drugs used for erectile dysfunction: case report and review of the literature.,"In the past 9 years, drugs for erectile dysfunction (ED) have been increasingly prescribed for men with erectile difficulty. These drugs, phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, help men with ED obtain and sustain an erection, improving both sexual function and sexual performance satisfaction. However, these drugs contain side effects.
A 56-year-old man developed an erythematous, circle-shaped lesion on his penis. The lesion was recurrent, with evidence of desquamation. The aim was to determine the source of the recurrent lesion based on its morphology and the patient's verbal history.
A clinical diagnosis of fixed drug eruption owing to use of the PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil (Cialis) was made. He was not rechallenged with the drug. However, he experienced a subsequent recurrence of the eruption on inadvertent rechallenge.
We believe this case to be the first report of this type of reaction owing to tadalafil. Therefore, fixed drug eruption is a newly observable side effect of this drug.",0,0
653,17260498,Fatal interstitial pneumonitis associated with docetaxel administration in a patient with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.,"Taxanes are widely used chemotherapeutic agents with the potential to induce pulmonary injury through a variety of mechanisms. Patients receiving these agents are at risk of acute or subacute pulmonary damage. The case is presented of a 72-year-old man with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and weekly administration of 30 mg/m2 docetaxel who developed subacute interstitial pneumonitis-related pulmonary fibrosis after seven doses and died despite mechanical ventilation and high-dose corticosteroid treatment. Even though only a few cases of this adverse event have been reported in the literature, severe docetaxel-induced pulmonary toxicity needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis when such patients present with respiratory symptoms.",0,0

The patient presented with fulminant microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia within 48 hr of initiating therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Other symptoms of drug hypersensitivity included nausea, vomiting, urticarial rash, and leukopenia. Because of her religious faith, the patient was supported without plasma therapy with use of intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, rituximab, and erythropoietin.",2007,7
655,17275666,Juvenile absence epilepsy exacerbated by valproic acid.,"Valproic acid is commonly and effectively used in the treatment of idiopathic generalized epilepsies, including juvenile absence epilepsy. Although several adverse effects are associated with this drug, it has only rarely been known to exacerbate seizures. Similar to antiarrhythmic drugs aggravating particular arrhythmias, antiepileptic drugs can paradoxically induce new seizure types or exacerbate existing ones. This reaction is better known with carbamazepine and phenytoin, but is less common with broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs such as valproic acid. This report describes a case of paradoxical, intravenous valproic acid-induced seizure exacerbation in a child with juvenile absence epilepsy, documented by video-electroencephalography.",2007,2
656,17277758,Acute endophthalmitis following intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin) injection.,"To report two cases of acute endophthalmitis following intravitreal bevacizumab injection.
Two patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration were treated sequentially with an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab and developed signs of severe but painless infectious endophthalmitis 2 days later. Vitreous samples were obtained, followed by the injection of vancomycin 1 mg/0.1 ml and ceftazidime 2.25 mg/0.1 ml. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to determine whether the isolated microorganisms were the same.
Coagulase-negative staphylococci were identified and isolated from the vitreous specimen of both patients. PFGE revealed different patterns of banding, excluding that interpatient contamination occured.
Infectious endophthalmitis is a potential complication of intravitreal bevacizumab injection.",2007,3
657,17285101,Pulmonary hypertension during lithium therapy: clinical case study.,"The authors presented a case of pulmonary hypertension during lithium therapy, while she has been on lithium for 6 years. The patient developed pulmonary hypertension without a prior diagnosed cardiac and/or pulmonary disease. This is the first report of pulmonary hypertension in an adult patient during lithium therapy.",2007,0
658,17298107,Coexistent psoriasis and lupus erythematosus treated with alefacept.,"Coexistence of psoriasis and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) is unusual. Although there have been reports of this occurrence, there have been no reports of this overlap syndrome treated with immunomodulators. We describe a case of coexisting psoriasis and SCLE initially treated with infliximab, and then alefacept. The patient's arthritis flared after the second infusion of infliximab, which was discontinued. During treatment with alefacept, the patient's psoriasis improved markedly without exacerbation of his photosensitive SCLE lesions.",2007,0
659,17301517,New-onset diabetic ketoacidosis induced by the addition of perospirone hydrochloride in a patient treated with risperidone.,"A 32-year-old man with a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with circulatory collapse and deep coma after 9 days of treatment with perospirone hydrochloride, a recently developed atypical antipsychotic agent available only in Japan. The new drug had been added to the long-standing treatment with risperidone. Diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis, he was given insulin and saline with discontinuation of all antipsychotics. Ultimately, diabetes was controlled by dietary therapy alone despite reintroduction of risperidone. The risk of new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with diabetic risk factors who are taking perospirone hydrochloride or other atypical antipsychotics should be kept in mind.",2007,0
660,17310853,Fatal venous thrombembolism complicating imatinib therapy in a patient with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor.,"Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is currently the therapy of choice for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The toxic effects of imatinib treatment are usually mild, and serious adverse events are rare. We report here the case of a patient with peritoneal metastases of GIST involving the pelvis treated by imatinib. Abdominal pain deteriorated early in the course of the therapy along with the enlargement of the tumors. The patient died suddenly, and the autopsy revealed pulmonary embolism originating from the deep vein thrombosis caused by the compression of common iliac vein by the tumor. The possibility of deep vein thrombosis caused by the compression of the veins by necrotic tumor should be considered in patients with abdominal or pelvic metastases of GIST, including patients treated with imatinib.",2006,12
661,17316891,Chemotherapy induced reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome.,"The reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLES) is a condition characterised by reversible neurological and radiological findings that has been associated with use of immunosuppressive, chemotherapeutic and more recently novel targeted therapies. We describe the case of a 50-year-old woman with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who developed status epilepticus shortly after receiving cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. The clinical, radiological and EEG findings during and post event are presented and are in keeping with a diagnosis of RPLES. Early recognition of this rare syndrome, supportive management and withdrawal of the offending agent appear to result in a reversal of the manifestations described.",2007,6
662,17319250,Fluctuating QTc interval in an asymptomatic patient treated with methadone for chronic pain.,"Prolongation of the QT interval associated with ventricular arrhythmias has been the most common cause of the restriction or withdrawal of drugs from the market in the past 10 years. Methadone, a synthetic opioid that is increasingly used for the management of chronic pain, has recently been implicated in the development of the prolonged QT syndrome. We present a case report of a patient who developed a prolonged QT while being treated with oral methadone for a chronic pain syndrome. Of particular interest in this patient is the fluctuation of the QT interval at a stable dose of methadone, suggesting that a single normal electrocardiogram (ECG) does not guarantee that the patient is not at risk of ventricular arrhythmias. After reviewing the current literature, we suggest that there is no dose of methadone that may be considered to be completely safe. Other risk factors for prolonged QT interval such as underlying cardiac abnormalities, electrolyte disturbances, and concurrent medications should be sought, and all patients should be monitored with serial ECGs even when methadone doses remain stable.",0,0
663,17324248,Piloerection induced by replacing fluvoxamine with milnacipran.,"To present a case of piloerection after replacing fluvoxamine maleate with milnacipran hydrochloride, and to analyse this effect based on receptor occupancy theory.
A 40-year-old female with a 3-year history of panic disorder was prescribed fluvoxamine 50 mg day(-1) in addition to clorazepate dipotassium and sulpiride. Depression was not improved and she complained of fatigue, lack of energy and drowsiness. These symptoms worsened within a few days of an increase in the dose of fluvoxamine to 50 mg twice daily. Since an interaction between fluvoxamine and tizanidine, prescribed by another clinic, was suspected, fluvoxamine was replaced with milnacipran 50 mg day(-1). Although her drowsiness improved, she complained of piloerection throughout her body. This symptom gradually abated within a week and when the dosage of milnacipran was increased to 100 mg day(-1) at 2 months, no further piloerection occurred. We calculated the changes in alpha(1)-adrenoceptor occupancy by endogenous norepinephrine during treatment with the usual doses of milnacipran, fluvoxamine and imipramine by using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters obtained from the literature.
The ratios of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor occupancy by endogenous norepinephrine during the treatment with milnacipran, fluvoxamine and imipramine to that without drug were estimated to be 7.13, 1.00 and 4.12, respectively. The alpha(1)-adrenoceptor occupancy by endogenous norepinephrine was increased in a dose-dependent manner by milnacipran, whereas fluvoxamine had essentially no effect.
The piloerection observed after the replacement of fluvoxamine with milnacipran in this patient appears to have been due to an increase in the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor occupancy by endogenous norepinephrine induced by milnacipran.",2007,6
664,17331261,Inhaled tobramycin solution-associated recurrent eosinophilia and severe persistent bronchospasm in a patient with cystic fibrosis: a case report.,"Delivery of tobramycin by inhalation to the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been proven to be effective and safe. The aerosol administration allows high concentrations of tobramycin to be delivered to the site of infection with limited systemic absorption. In rare patients, systemic absorption of inhaled tobramycin may be significant enough to produce toxic effects, such as renal and vestibular toxicities.
We report a patient with CF who developed recurrent eosinophilia and severe persistent bronchospasm following repeated administration of preservative-free tobramycin by inhalation, beginning at 16 months of age. Also, he developed similar signs and symptoms when he was administered tobramycin intravenously on one occasion at 5 1/2 years. The patient had a history of environmental allergies. Temporal sequence of his signs and symptoms after each administration of tobramycin (similar to re-challenge testing), and his improvement after discontinuation of the drug strongly suggest an adverse drug reaction.
Hypersensitivity reaction should be considered in patients who develop recurrent eosinophilia and deterioration of pulmonary function following the use of tobramycin by inhalation or by intravenous administration.",2007,3
665,17346586,Orthodontic treatment of patients using bisphosphonates: a report of 2 cases.,"The pharmacologic agent bisphosphonate has recently received much attention in the dental literature. Bisphosphonates in oral or intravenous forms are used to treat various diseases such as certain cancers, bone- and calcium-related disorders, osteoporosis, and osteopenia. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone turnover and result in increased bone-mineral density. The most serious dental side effect of bisphosphonate treatment (particularly when it is administered intravenously) is, paradoxically, osteonecrosis of the mandible or the maxilla represented by exposed nonhealing bone. Other related complications include decreased bone healing and inhibition of orthodontic tooth movement. This article reports the orthodontic treatment of 2 patients who were taking bisphosphonates.",2007,3
666,17352036,Acute pancreatitis and amiodarone: a case report.,"Amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, is one of the most effective drugs used in the treatment of ventricular and paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. Adverse effects of amiodarone including pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, aggravation of arrhythmia, and thyroid diseases are well understood. A 66-year old woman with acute pancreatitis was admitted to our hospital with the complaint of epigastralgia radiating to both flanks for two months. Her symptoms and elevation of pancreatic enzymes did not respond to conventional medical treatment of pancreatitis for 18 d. No known causal factors for pancreatitis such as biliary tract stone, hypertriglyceridemia and alcohol consumption could be identified. Under the suspicion of amiodarone-induced acute pancreatitis, amiodarone was substituted by propafenone. Her symptoms soon alleviated and serum lipase level declined. Three months after hospital discharge, the abdominal pain did not recur. Amiodarone was approved to treat recurrent ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia that has been resistant to other medications since 1986. Pancreatitis is a very rare adverse effect associated with the use of amiodarone, and only four cases of amiodarone-induced pancreatitis have been reported in literature. We report a patient who developed acute pancreatitis during amiodarone therapy.",2007,2
667,17364199,Tuberculous uveitis after treatment with etanercept.,"Etanercept is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor that has been licensed in the United States for the treatment of adult and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis as well as psoriatic arthritis. Reactivation of tuberculosis is a complication of its use. We report the first case of tuberculous uveitis due to etanercept.
We performed a clinical chart review.
A 58-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our hospital for chronic unilateral granulomatous panuveitis of the right eye (RE). She was on etanercept and methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. Since the patient was immunosuppressed with etanercept and since the uveitis was granulomatous we considered tuberculosis as a possible etiology. An aqueous humor tap was performed and sent for polymerase chain reaction analyses of Herpes simplex, Herpes zoster, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT). This last test was positive. Another aqueous humor sample was taken and sent for microscopic examination of sputum for acid-fast bacilli and culture, both of which were positive for MT. A diagnosis of tuberculous uveitis was established; the patient was treated with rifampin, isoniazid pyrazinamide, and ethambutol and etanercept was stopped. Four months later there were no cells in the anterior chamber and the vitreous was clear.
To our knowledge this is the first reported case of tuberculous uveitis following treatment with etanercept. This etiology has to be considered in patients taking this drug who present with intraocular inflammation.",2007,9
668,17366681,A complex pattern of melanonychia and onycholysis after treatment with pemetrexed for lung cancer.,"A 53-year-old black man was diagnosed with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung and treated initially with 4 cycles of paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin and external-beam radiation therapy with a good clinicoradiologic response. The patient tolerated the chemotherapy well and did not develop any skin or nail changes during that period of time. His lung cancer recurred 10 months later, when he was found to have bone metastases. Second-line chemotherapy with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks was commenced. A week prior, the patient was started on folic acid 1 mg orally daily and given an injection of vitamin B12 1000 microg intramuscularly that was continued every 3 cycles thereafter. Dexamethasone 4 mg orally twice daily was given around the time of chemotherapy administration to prevent the dermatitis associated with the drug. The patient denied taking other drugs. Two months into his second-line chemotherapy, he developed multiple, concomitant, transverse and longitudinal black lines in all of his fingernails and toenails. After an interval of 3 months, he presented a complex pattern of nail hyperpigmentation, from combined dense horizontal and longitudinal streaks in some nails to diffuse black discoloration in others (Figure). Other associated changes included koilonychia, dystrophy, and friability of nail plates. Along with normal results of a hepatorenal panel and normal serum vitamin B12 and folate levels, no metabolic or endocrinologic alterations were present to explain the nail pigmentation and dystrophic changes. Results of his mycologic examination and cultures came back negative. When questioned, he denied taking any other drugs including other alternative medicine approaches or vitamin supplements, particularly retinoids, well known for causing severe nail dystrophy.",0,0
669,17373180,Osteomyelitis occurring during infliximab treatment of severe psoriasis.,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, such as infliximab, decrease the body's inflammatory response and thus the body's reaction to infection. Given the immune-mediated processes in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, patients with these disorders may benefit from infliximab therapy but may also suffer from an increased risk of infection. We present the first case of osteomyelitis in a patient receiving infliximab therapy for severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Infliximab and its serious adverse effects are discussed, and other cases of osteomyelitis with infliximab use are also reviewed.",2007,2
670,17381671,Serotonin syndrome caused by interaction between citalopram and fentanyl.,"To report a case of serotonin syndrome associated with interaction between fentanyl and citalopram, as evidenced by medication history, clinical features and reversal following discontinuation of fentanyl.
A 65-year-old patient chronically treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram developed confusion, agitation, tachycardia, tremors, myoclonic jerks and unsteady gait, consistent with serotonin syndrome, following initiation of fentanyl, and all symptoms and signs resolved following discontinuation of fentanyl. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, serotonin syndrome was a probable adverse reaction associated with co-administration of citalopram and fentanyl.
Serotonin syndrome is a potentially lethal pharmacodynamic interaction between medications that increase serotonergic transmission at the synaptic junction. The development of new pharmacological agents with varied properties and actions has increased the risk of serotonin syndrome as a clinical diagnosis. SSRIs and fentanyl are commonly co-administered, especially in the setting of chronic or malignant pain, as underlying depression may contribute to the pathogenesis of pain.
Healthcare professionals should be aware of the possible development of serotonin syndrome as a complication of initiation of fentanyl and other phenylpiperidine opioids in patients treated with SSRIs.",2007,4
671,17387702,Renal failure after high-dose methotrexate in a child homozygous for MTHFR C677T polymorphism.,"We report the case of an 11-year-old female treated for mediastinal T-cell lymphoma who presented renal failure following the second cycle of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX). Because of life threatening plasma methotrexate (MTX) levels, carboxypeptidase G2 (CPDG2) was administered resulting in a dramatic decrease within 1 hr. The patient recovered from renal failure and no other side effects were observed. Homozygosity for the methylentetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism diagnosed by molecular genetic analysis was the only explanation for this toxicity.",2008,1
672,17404582,Docetaxel-induced Meibomian duct inflammation and blockage leading to chalazion formation.,"We report a 71-year male with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer who was treated with weekly docetaxel for 12 weeks and developed significant eye irritation and dryness during treatment. Subsequently, the patient presented with a lower eyelid mass, which on excision was demonstrated to be a chalazion. Docetaxel induced Meibomian duct inflammation and blockage is the likely cause of this presentation in a patient with no history of eyelid masses in the past.",2007,0
673,17406804,Radiation recall pneumonitis induced by gemcitabine.,"Radiation recall pneumonitis describes a very rare reaction in a previously irradiated area of pulmonary tissue after application of pharmacological agents. A case of recall pneumonitis induced by gemcitabine is reported.
A 64-year-old female patient with metastasized esophageal carcinoma received simultaneous chemoradiotherapy of the upper mediastinum with 50.4 Gy and cisplatin/5-fluorouracil. 8 months later she was scheduled for salvage chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8) and docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) day 8) due to locally progressive disease. After having received gemcitabine on day 1 of the second course, the patient developed dry cough, subfebrile temperatures and dyspnea within 48 h. A CT of the thorax revealed newly developed bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacity corresponding to the previous radiation fields. Chemotherapy was stopped and systemic application of prednisolone was initiated. 2 months later symptoms had resolved with a control CT of the thorax showing complete regression of the pulmonary changes.
Gemcitabine-induced recall pneumonitis is a rarely reported phenomenon and should be taken into account even after extended time interval to the previous radiotherapy.",2007,4
674,17426073,Glycopeptide-induced neutropenia: cross-reactivity between vancomycin and teicoplanin.,"To report teicoplanin-related neutropenia that developed after an episode of neutropenia induced by vancomycin therapy.
A 57-year-old female suffered from osteomyelitis of the left humerus, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2.8 x 10(3)/mm3 and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.28 x 10(3)/mm3, occurring after 24 days of vancomycin therapy. Vancomycin was changed to teicoplanin and the agranulocytosis resolved 4 days later. However, a new episode of neutropenia, with a WBC count of 2.8 x 10(3)/mm3 and ANC of 0.448 x 10(3)/mm3, occurred 11 days after teicoplanin initiation. Agranulocytosis resolved 4 days following withdrawal of teicoplanin.
Because of the close time relationship between drug administration and the development of symptoms and signs, as well as between drug withdrawal and changes in WBC count and ANC, the episodes of neutropenia were suspected to be drug related. Teicoplanin-induced agranulocytosis that followed vancomycin-induced agranulocytosis suggests a possible cross-reactivity between the 2 drugs. Both reactions were categorized as probable according to the Naranjo probability scale.
For all patients with vancomycin-induced neutropenia, possible cross-reactivity of teicoplanin should be monitored.",2007,5
675,1743388,Cutaneous ulceration: an unusual complication of intravenous pentamidine therapy.,"Pentamidine is one of two agents currently used to treat infections with Pneumocystis carinii. The intramuscular route of administration is associated with cutaneous side effects such as dermal necrosis, sterile abscesses and ulcer formation at the injection site, while urticaria may develop near the site of intravenous drug infusion. This is a report of a renal transplant patient with Pneumocystis pneumonia who developed chemical cellulitis and ulceration following the extravasation of intravenous pentamidine into the soft tissues of the left hand and forearm. The area healed slowly over 7 weeks, but there was a residual loss of cutaneous sensation. In a review of the literature no report of a similar case was found.",1991,0
676,17438184,Cosmetic permanent fillers for soft tissue augmentation: a new contraindication for interferon therapies.,"Most of the new fillers used for soft tissue augmentation in aesthetic dermatology are considered well tolerated, but very little data are available on their long-term tolerability, especially in patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy.
A 48-year-old woman presented with disfiguring facial edema 10 weeks after she began antiviral therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C infection. The major affected sites had been treated 10 years before with Artecoll, a permanent filler containing polymethylmethacrylate. A treatment attempt with allopurinol was initiated while antiviral therapy was continued and was successfully completed after 6 months. Despite significant improvement, extended plastic surgery was necessary for facial reconstruction.
The normal host response to a cosmetic filler is a weak granulomatous reaction. Interferon and other immunostimulatory medications can lead to an exacerbation of this preexisting low-grade chronic inflammation that is quite similar to interferon-triggered sarcoidosis. This potential long-term risk has medicolegal implications for informed consent and for the potential use of both permanent fillers and interferon.",2007,4
677,17444802,Tumor-volume increase at beginning of primary treatment with topical interferon alpha 2-beta in a case of conjunctiva-cornea intraepithelial neoplasia.,"The aim of this study was to report on the effectiveness and tumor side effects of topical interferon (INF) alpha 2-beta in a case of conjunctiva-cornea intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) of a patient that rejected any surgical procedure.
This study is a case report description.
An 81-year-old man with a history of neoplasies of the colon and prostate and anticoagulant treatment was referred for treatment of an ocular surface neoplasia on his left eye. Pathognomonic signs of CIN were present. The patient rejected surgical procedures. A regimen of topical INF alpha 2-beta 4 times daily was administered. An increase in tumor volume of 25% was observable 15 days after the beginning of therapy. No subjective discomfort was reported. The treatment continued with follow-ups every 15 days. The progressive regression was remarkable. Complete regression of the CIN was observable after 60 days of therapy. No other side-effects were detected.
Topical INF alpha 2-beta is a valid choice for the treatment of CIN in patients for whom surgery is not possible. The increase of tumor volume at the beginning of therapy does not require the suspension of treatment.",2007,4
678,17448102,Managing cardiovascular collapse in severe flecainide overdose without recourse to extracorporeal therapy.,"Flecainide overdose can rapidly result in profound cardiovascular collapse, and is associated with a relatively high mortality. A case is described where a woman with major toxicity and high serum levels was managed without recourse to invasive modalities such as cardiopulmonary bypass or extracorporeal therapies. Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate is recognized as effective therapy for hypotension and arrhythmias. More recent case reports have concentrated on the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. In this report and other reports describing successful resuscitation, the total dose of sodium bicarbonate is conspicuously higher than in reports describing extracorporeal interventions. Sodium bicarbonate should be given early in the resuscitation, and re-administered as frequently as required, targeting an alkaline pH and improved cardiac output, while accepting hypernatraemia. This case demonstrates the maxim that the correct dose of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate is 'enough'. Cardiopulmonary bypass support can be considered as a salvage therapy.",2007,4
679,17458405,Ezetimibe-induced acute pancreatitis.,"Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering agent that inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and other related phytosterols. It is used alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering agents in the treatment of various forms of hypercholesterolemia. Since its FDA approval in 2002, there are no known citations of ezetimibe-induced pancreatitis.",2007,4
680,17473493,Selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene-associated aggravation of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.,"A 53-year-old postmenopausal woman, who had a family history of cryptogenic liver cirrhosis, was diagnosed with osteoporosis, and started on the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene 60 mg/day orally. She developed marked liver dysfunction. Her body mass index (BMI) was 26.5. Her blood chemistry indicated AST 342 IU/L, ALT 356 IU/L, and hyaluronic acid 255 ng/mL. An oral glucose tolerance test showed impaired glucose tolerance with marked insulin resistance. Histologically, we diagnosed this case as having pre-cirrhotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This is the first histologically confirmed case of NASH that was aggravated by raloxifene.",2007,0

682,17494808,Hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like syndrome associated with the use of lenalidomide.,"Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent approved for use in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, and in combination with dexamethasone for refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma. Pulmonary toxicity is believed to be uncommon. In this report, we describe a patient receiving lenalidomide in whom dyspnea, fever, hypoxia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates developed. BAL demonstrated a significant lymphocytic alveolitis typical for hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Extensive workup for other causes, including infections, was negative. Finally, the patient had improvement in symptoms and oxygenation after withdrawing lenalidomide and recurrence of symptoms when the drug was restarted. Thus, the patient's clinical course and workup strongly support a diagnosis of lenalidomide-induced hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like syndrome. Physicians should be cognizant of this potential complication in patients receiving thalidomide or thalidomide-like drugs who present with fever and pulmonary infiltrates and fail to improve despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.",2007,5
683,17505739,Toxoplasmosis retinochoroiditis after photodynamic therapy and intravitreal triamcinolone for a supposed choroidal neovascularization: a case report.,"The purpose is to report a complication after photodynamic therapy (PDT) and intravitreal triamcinolone for a presumed choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration. Photodynamic therapy and intravitreal triamcinolone were used in an 84-year-old man with choroidal neovascularization in the left eye. Forty-five days after therapy, the patient returned with a severe necrotizing uveitis in the posterior pole and vitritis. Laboratory investigation disclosed a high anti-Toxoplasma IgG titer. Therapy with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine and folinic acid resulted in total lesion healing although central vision was lost. Intravitreal triamcinolone may have had an influence on the exacerbation of retinochoroiditis in the posterior pole of the patient. Although rare, this complication may not be disregarded in the cases that require intraocular corticosteroids for treatment of several conditions, especially in patients who had previously suffered from toxoplasmosis infection.",0,0
684,17509184,Ethambutol toxicity manifesting as acute onset psychosis.,"Ethambutol is commonly used for the treatment of tuberculous and atypical mycobacterial infection. Central nervous system (CNS) toxicity other than optic neuropathy is not widely reported. A 40-year-old man with advanced HIV infection and Mycobacterium avium complex infection experienced rapid cognitive decline after commencement of ethambutol, and symptoms fully resolved with cessation.",2007,4
685,1751354,Psoriasis induced by interferon-alpha.,"Recombinant human interferon-alpha has been used in the treatment of several cancers, but there have been several reports that it may exacerbate psoriasis or trigger off its onset. We report four patients, three of whom first developed psoriasis and one who had an aggravation of the condition during treatment with interferon-alpha. Three of the patients had the carcinoid syndrome and one a renal carcinoma, and all were treated with interferon-alpha 2b or 2a (IFN-alpha 2b, 2a) with doses ranging from 1.5 x 10(6) U daily to 18 x 10(6) U three times weekly. In two of the patients there appeared to be a correlation between the severity of the psoriasis and the dosage of interferon.",1991,11
686,17519584,Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome associated with a marked increase in anti-paramyxovirus antibody titers in a scleroderma patient.,"Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) is characterized by a severe multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction that usually appears after prolonged exposure to certain drugs and may be related to reactivation of herpes viruses. There have been few reports regarding the clinical association of DIHS with pathogens other than herpes viruses.
We report a case of scleroderma with DIHS associated with paramyxovirus infection. A 61-year-old man with early diffuse cutaneous scleroderma with myositis and progressive interstitial pneumonia developed generalized erythema with high fever 3 weeks after taking sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The diagnosis of DIHS was made based on the patient's history of using an offending drug, clinical manifestations and laboratory data showing peripheral eosinophilia with the presence of atypical lymphocytes. Virological tests showed significant increases of antibody titers against mumps virus and parainfluenza virus type 2, which strongly suggested that paramyxovirus infection occurred during the clinical course of DIHS.
These findings suggest that paramyxovirus infection had contributed to the development of DIHS in this patient and that there is a need to seek evidence of other viral infections in some cases of DIHS, especially those without herpes virus reactivation/infection.",2007,9
687,17522786,Neurointensive care management of raised intracranial pressure caused by severe valproic acid intoxication.,"We describe the neurointensive care (NIC) management of a patient with severe cerebral swelling and raised intracranial pressure (ICP) after severe sodium valproic acid (VPA) intoxication. A previously healthy 25-year old male with mild tonic-clonic epilepsy was found unconscious with serum VPA levels >10,000 micromol/l. The patient deteriorated to Glasgow Motor Scale score (GMS) 2 and a CT scan showed signs of raised ICP. Early ICP was elevated, >50 mm Hg, and continuous EEG monitoring showed isoelectric readings.
The patient was treated with an ICP-guided protocol including mild hyperventilation, normovolemia, head elevation and intermittent doses of mannitol. Due to refractory elevations of ICP, high-dose pentobarbital infusion was initiated, and ICP gradually normalised.
There were several systemic complications including coagulopathy, hypocalcemia and pancreatitis. The patient remained in a depressed level of consciousness for 2 months but gradually recovered, showing a good recovery with minor subjective cognitive deficits by 6 months.
We conclude that NIC may be an important treatment option in cases of severe intoxication causing cerebral swelling.",2007,0
688,17526968,Bleomycin induced hyperpigmentation with yolk sac tumor.,"Hyperpigmentation is one of the cutaneous side effects of chemotherapautic agents, but it is usually accepted as a cosmetic problem. We report a child with yolk sac tumor who developed localized pigmentation after the first course of chemotherapy regimen that included cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin. The hyperpigmentation was diffuse scattered, flagellate like and linear streaking which was thought to be mainly related to the skin toxicity of bleomycin.",2007,5
689,17536204,Capecitabine-induced headache responding to diltiazem.,"Headaches have been reported as a potential side effect of capecitabine therapy. However, severe limiting headaches are rarely experienced in this setting and no known therapy has been described for such a serious side effect.
We report the case of a patient treated with capecitabine and radiation for rectal adenocarcinoma. The patient developed grade 3 capecitabine-induced headache. A cause-effect relationship to capecitabine was suggested due to resolution of headache with capecitabine withdrawal and reappearance with capecitabine rechallenge. The patient's headache resolved with diltiazem therapy and she was able to complete capecitabine and radiation therapy without further adverse events.
Capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are known vasospasm inducers. We hypothesize that capecitabine-induced headache is vascular in nature. This likely explains the noted response to a calcium channel blocker (CCB), namely diltiazem. CCBs should be considered in the treatment of 5-FU or capecitabine-induced headaches.",2007,0
690,17547624,Brugada type electrocardiographic changes induced by concomitant use of lithium and propafenone in patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.,We report a case of ST elevation in right precordial leads compatible with type 1 Brugada syndrome following administration of propafenone in a patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who was receiving lithium at concentrations within therapeutic levels. The mechanism of the electrocardiogram changes was considered to be caused by the two drugs synergistic sodium channel blocking effects.,2007,6
691,17551408,Ruptured Meckel diverticulum mimicking mucositis in a patient receiving induction therapy for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"A Meckel diverticulum is an embryonic remnant of the vitellointestinal duct. It is present in approximately 2% of the population and is estimated to cause symptoms<5% of the time. It generally results in painless bleeding or abdominal pain. Rarely, it can rupture, resulting in peritonitis and gram-negative sepsis. We present the case of a 17-year-old male who ruptured his Meckel diverticulum 23 days after the beginning of induction chemotherapy for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We postulate that gastritis caused by dexamethasone, mucositis caused by doxorubicin, and the unique anatomic nature of a Meckel diverticulum may have contributed to this extremely unlikely and previously unreported event.",2007,6
692,17556909,Bortezomib-induced paralytic ileus is a potential gastrointestinal side effect of this first-in-class anticancer proteasome inhibitor.,"Bortezomib is the first anticancer proteasome inhibitor introduced into clinical practice. It has been recently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, an incurable plasma cell tumour that accounts for 10-15% of all haematologic malignancies and for approximately 20% of deaths. Gastrointestinal toxicity associated with the use of this drug is common but generally mild to moderate. Paralytic ileus in patients undergoing bortezomib treatment has been reported, although a definite attribution to bortezomib administration has not been established. We report a myeloma patient who developed severe paralytic ileus during bortezomib therapy, which presented in the context of progressive constipation without other known causes and which regressed promptly with medical management after drug cessation, suggesting a direct causal relationship. Awareness of the various potential gastrointestinal toxic effects of bortezomib is of relevance given the growing number of patients undergoing treatment with this important and effective new cancer drug.",2007,7
693,1756352,Delusional parasitosis associated with phenelzine.,A woman developed delusional parasitosis when taking phenelzine. The delusion occurred in an agitated hypomanic state and was preceded by an intense pruritus. It completely remitted following withdrawal of phenelzine combined with a low dose of haloperidol (1 mg/day) for several days. This unusual psychopathology is probably encountered more by dermatologists than by mental health professionals.,1991,11
694,17596682,Interstitial pneumonitis and alveolar hemorrhage complicating use of rituximab: case report and review of the literature.,"The use of rituximab has been uncommonly associated with delayed pulmonary toxicity.

695,1759924,Fulminant metoclopramide induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome rapidly responsive to intravenous dantrolene.,We report a case of fulminant neuroleptic malignant syndrome in a man aged 70 developing within 12 hours of starting six-hourly intravenous metoclopramide. The muscle rigidity and hyperpyrexia were unresponsive to intravenous benztropine but resolved within one hour of intravenous dantrolene 2 mg/kg. Within six hours the patient had a partial relapse which resolved completely following further intravenous dantrolene 2 mg/kg. This case demonstrates that the rapid effect of intravenous dantrolene can be life saving in fulminant neuroleptic malignant syndrome.,1991,10
696,17610180,Gastric outlet obstruction due to an iatrogenic cause in a neonatal period - report of two cases.,"Gastric mucosa hyperplasia is a rare cause of upper gastrointestinal obstruction in the neonatal period. One of the etiologic factors of this disorder is prolonged prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) therapy of neonates with congenital cyanotic heart diseases. Continuous PGE1 administration ensures patency of the ductus arteriosus, which is essential for stabilizing the general condition until cardiac surgery can be performed. The clinical symptoms of gastric mucosa foveolar hyperplasia due to long-term PGE1 therapy simulate hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. However, the characteristic ultrasound appearance of both pathologies facilitates determination of the final diagnosis and further treatment. We present two cases of neonates with gastric mucosa and submucosa hyperplasia revealed during ultrasound examination. The results of the ultrasound examination combined with clinical anamnesis allowed diagnosis of gastric mucosa foveolar hyperplasia due to prolonged PGE1 therapy.",2009,8
697,17619811,Colchicine-induced rhabdomyolysis.,"A case of colchicine-induced rhabdomyolysis is reported. A 79-year-old man with ischemic heart disease, chronic atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, and gout arthritis was hospitalized because of fatigue, myalgia, and leg weakness, shortly after starting treatment with colchicine. Investigation confirmed the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, and discontinuation of colchicine resulted in resolution of clinical and biochemical features of rhabdomylysis. Colchicine-induced rhabdomyolysis is a rare complication, and the postulated mechanisms and risk factors for this severe complication are discussed.",2007,12
698,17624096,5-Fluorouracil cardiotoxicity complicating treatment of stage IIB cervical cancer--case report.,"A 31-year-old female was found to have FIGO Stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. The patient began her prescribed radiation therapy and 5-fluorouracil radio-sensitizing chemotherapy. During the first day of infusion, she began having severe shortness of breath. Cardiac evaluation revealed acute congestive heart failure with a cardiac ejection fraction of 19%. Radiation was continued without chemotherapy. Four years later, the patient is alive and well with an ejection fraction of 53%.",2007,0
699,17627694,Topical vaginal oestrogen cream used for treatment of burn injury of vaginal mucosa after misapplication of 100% acetic acid in a perimenopausal woman: a case report.,"Three to five per cent acetic acid is commonly used in the field of gynaecology for colposcopic examinations of the cervix. It gives an 'acetowhite' effect that may assist clinicians in identifying neoplastic areas.
A perimenopausal woman was treated with acetic acid for abnormal Pap smear report (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1). During application, the patient complained of burning sensation of vagina and vulva. The vagina was saline-irrigated after realising that the acetic acid had not been diluted. Following this incident, the patient was seen weekly and treated with conjugated vaginal oestrogen cream. The patient recovered and the vagina mucosa healed within two weeks.
Acetic acid is corrosive and may cause vagina bleeding. Oestrogen cream can be used in an attempt to minimise the adverse reaction and speed the healing process.",2007,8
700,1765991,Induction of systemic lupus erythematosus by interferon-gamma in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.,"The development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) after 38 months of therapy with recombinant human interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma) was observed in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition to glomerulonephritis and a butterfly rash, previously negative tests for antinuclear, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies became positive. We assume that rIFN-gamma induced the de novo development of SLE in our patient.",1991,10
701,17660778,Bisphosphonate induced osteochemonecrosis of the jaw mimicking a tumour.,Osteonecrosis has been well-documented in the past. We present an example of this complication that we recently saw in our department which on initial presentation appeared to be squamous cell carcinoma. This case is particularly important as the condition will become more and more prevalent and therefore it is imperative that GDPs in primary care are aware of it.,2007,7
702,17665812,Clozapine-induced eosinophilia and switch to quetiapine in a patient with chronic schizophrenia with suicidal tendencies.,"Clozapine has proven effective in reducing morbidity and suicidality in chronic non-remitting patients with schizophrenia. Occasionally, despite good therapeutic response, clozapine must be stopped due to dangerous side effects such as agranulocytosis. Drug-induced eosinophilia is a non-dose-dependent side effect of clozapine. In cases of mild increments of eosinophils and if the patient is asymptomatic, there is no need to make an immediate decision. However, if the increment is severe and producing symptoms, withdrawing the probable causative drug is warranted. There is a possible association between eosinophilia and myocarditis, a life-threatening condition. The efficacy of corticosteroid therapy in the treatment of eosinophilia has not been clearly established. We present a case report where switching from clozapine to quetiapine maintained the improvement in clinical status, after remittance of eosinophilia.",2007,0
703,17667216,Metformin-associated lactic acidosis precipitated by diarrhea.,"Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a serious metabolic complication that occurs because of metformin accumulation in patients who become dehydrated or developed acute renal failure. Bicarbonate hemodialysis treatment should take place early in the course of management, especially in patients with severe metabolic acidosis who fail to respond to intravenous bicarbonate therapy or in whom renal failure is present. We report a case of MALA in which acute renal failure resulting from dehydration secondary to diarrhea and poor oral intake likely caused MALA. Early recognition of this condition and initiation of effective treatment can improve outcome.",0,0
704,17671884,Red blood cell anemia in a patient with pemphigus vulgaris induced by the use of mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone.,"Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive drug used in renal transplantation, lupus nephritis and pemphigus vulgaris patients. An apparent link is described between the use of MMF with prednisone to treat pemphigus vulgaris and the development of red blood cell anemia. Specifically, after initiation of 500 mg MMF twice a day given in conjunction with the long-standing use of prednisone, which had been tapered to a dose of 10 mg daily, the patient's red blood cell count dropped by 17% over 7 weeks. To put this into perspective, total aplasia of red blood cells for 40 days would result in a drop of 30-33% in the red blood cell count. In the transplantation literature, MMF has been noted to lower red blood cell counts. One previous study of four transplant patients whose immediate post-transplantation immunosuppression utilized corticosteroids, cyclosporine, MMF, and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin noted anemia in 13% of them. The dermatology literature heretofore has not noted that anemia is a side effect of patients taking MMF to treat pemphigus. This report suggests that anemia can occur due to MMF, in particular when it is given with prednisone, a side effect well documented in the transplantation literature when the triple combination of MMF, cyclosporine and prednisone is used. It would therefore seem prudent to monitor red and white blood cell counts in patients taking MMF. A review of the literature also reveals that MMF is a safe medication that appears to have a more favorable side effect profile than azathioprine, although it is more expensive than azathioprine.",2007,0
705,17675030,Clinical profile of oxcarbazepine-related angioneurotic edema: case report and review.,"Oxcarbazepine, a carbamazepine analog, was approved for use as an antiepileptic agent in the United States in 2000. A search of the United States Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System identified nine cases of oxcarbazepine-associated angioedema in pediatric patients aged 16 years and younger. We describe in detail the first U.S. case report, of a 4(1/2)-year-old boy who experienced angioedema during treatment with oxcarbazepine. The reporting rate for angioedema was calculated to be 9.8 cases per 1,000,000 pediatric patients. Oxcarbazepine-associated angioedema manifested by swelling of the face, eyes, lips, or tongue or difficulty swallowing or breathing (or both) is a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction for which early recognition and management are vital.",2007,8
706,17697264,Veno-occlusive disease of the liver after lung transplantation.,"Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver is mainly described after chemo-irradiation conditioning regimens during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has been sporadically reported after kidney and liver transplantation. In the latter cases, it is commonly attributed to azathioprine and/or tacrolimus. One case of tacrolimus-induced hepatic VOD developing after lung transplantation (LT) has been recently reported. Here we describe another case of VOD occurring after LT, but in which the causative role was played by azathioprine.",2007,9
707,17705565,Establishing causality in pediatric adverse drug reactions: use of the Naranjo probability scale.,"Carbamazepine hypersensitivity syndrome is a rare, life-threatening condition. Its diagnosis is critical to avoid future exposure to aromatic anticonvulsants. Pediatricians rarely use a systematic approach to establish the cause of drug reactions in the clinical setting. We describe the use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale to establish causality in three cases of suspected anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome with the aim of introducing clinicians to this effective tool. Our analysis reveals that this method is useful, but also highlights potential areas for its improvement.",2007,0
708,17710018,PET scintigraphy of etoposide-induced pulmonary toxicity.,"A patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia developed drug-induced pulmonary toxicity after using low dose oral etoposide. Because etoposide-induced pulmonary toxicity is an uncommon but serious adverse event, clinicians must be vigilant about the possibility of it, so that the optimal treatment can start as soon as possible. This report demonstrates that PET scintigraphy might be a helpful tool in the early diagnosis of drug-induced pulmonary toxicity.",2007,9
709,1772299,Detection of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in a patient with L-tryptophan induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.,The Center for Disease Control has received numerous reports of an eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome related to products containing L-tryptophan.

712,17763133,Simvastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis following cyclosporine treatment for uveitis.,"The purpose of this study was to heighten awareness of a potentially life-threatening drug interaction in patients with chronic uveitis treated with cyclosporine. A 69-year-old female with chronic posterior uveitis was treated with cyclosporine while on concomitant oral simvastatin for hypercholesterolemia. Rhabdomyolysis developed with acute renal failure from the probable interaction between these drugs. Discontinuation of simvastatin and cyclosporine resulted in resolution of rhabdomyolysis and normalization of renal function. Statins are associated with a small, dose-related risk of myopathy, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis. Cyclosporine is a potent inhibitor of simvastatin metabolism, and may therefore facilitate simvastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of statins and cyclosporine should be avoided.",0,0
713,17823522,Generalized lichen nitidus with involvement of the palms following interferon alpha treatment.,"Lichen nitidus is an uncommon dermatosis of unknown etiology. Here we present the case of a generalized lichen nitidus with involvement of the palms in a patient with hepatitis C after systemic treatment with interferon alpha and ribavirin. Furthermore in our patient we could show a strong lesional expression of MxA, a protein specifically induced by type I interferon. It is tempting to speculate that interferon alpha may be involved in the pathogenesis of lichen nitidus.",2007,0
714,17827517,Sirolimus-eluting stent thrombosis several years after clopidogrel discontinuation.,"Despite recent meta-analyses showing either similar rates or only slightly increased rates of stent thrombosis in patients with a drug-eluting stent, clinicians remain concerned about the risk of late stent thrombosis in these patients. We are reporting on a ""very-very"" late stent thrombosis that occurred 43 months post-implantation. We believe this represents the most delayed reported thrombosis post-sirolimus-eluting stent implantation, which might not have been preventable using even the latest FDA recommendations.",2007,9
715,17852449,Outcome of pregnancy in women treated with all-trans retinoic acid; a case report and review of literature.,"All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) has been proved to be an effective treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), inducing remission in more than 90% of cases. Treatment of APL in pregnancy is controversial as the use of ATRA has been questioned due to the teratogenic effect of retinoids. We report a case of pregnancy in a woman exposed to ATRA during the first trimester. The baby was born healthy, without any anomalies. Review of all reported cases of the use of ATRA in pregnancy revealed no serious adverse outcomes or congenital anomalies although only very few cases had exposure in the first trimester.",2007,10
716,17873198,Pulmonary toxicity associated with erlotinib.,"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) related to therapy with the drug gefitinib has been well reported. The adverse pulmonary effects of erlotinib are less well known. We report a case of fatal pulmonary toxicity in a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who received erlotinib. He had been found to have pathologic findings of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on the resected lung cancer specimen prior to receiving erlotinib. This case and other published evidence should alert physicians to the possibility of fatal erlotinib-induced ILD. Similar to reports in patients receiving gefitinib, those with pathologic findings of UIP on resected lung specimens or known pulmonary fibrosis may be at particular risk for erlotinib pulmonary toxicity.",2007,9
717,17876386,Torsade de pointes associated with moxifloxacin: a rare but potentially fatal adverse event.,"Torsade de pointes occuring due to a long QT interval is a rare but potentially fatal arrhythmia. Acquired long QT develops most commonly because of drugs that prolong ventricular repolarization. It has been reported that fluoroquinolone antimicrobials prolong the corrected QT interval but rarely cause torsade de pointes. A patient with torsade de pointes risk factors (female sex, advanced age, extreme bradycardia and renal failure) who developed the condition on the fourth day of 400 mg/day of oral moxifloxacin treatment is presented. After the moxifloxacin was stopped, the corrected QT interval normalized and a permanent cardiac pacemaker was implanted. During 11 months of follow-up, arrhythmia did not recur.",2007,9
718,17880357,Ischaemic complications of Glypressin in liver disease: a case series.,"To report three cases of extensive skin necrosis in cirrhotic patients treated with the vasoconstrictor agent terlipressin (Glypressin).
We identified three patients who developed skin necrosis and determined any factors, which put them at an increased risk of doing so.
Two patients were obese and developed extensive abdominal wall skin necrosis. The third patient had lower limb chronic venous insufficiency and developed extensive necrosis of both lower limbs.
With increasing clinical use of terlipressin and an increasing incidence of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related cirrhosis, the incidence of these serious complications is likely to rise. Earlier recognition and treatment may lead to improved outcome.",2007,10
719,17921794,Rapid onset of muscle weakness (rhabdomyolysis) associated with the combined use of simvastatin and colchicine.,"We report a case of a patient with mild chronic renal insufficiency who had been taking simvastatin for over a year and developed acute weakness within 3 weeks after the start of treatment with colchicine for acute gouty bursitis. Profound muscle weakness of lower extremities with inability to stand up and/or walk was present. Elevated muscle enzymes and findings on electromyography were consistent with myopathy. Rapid improvement in muscle strength accompanied by prompt resolution of abnormal elevation of muscle enzymes followed cessation of both medications. Both colchicine and statin therapy may be associated with myopathy, which usually occurs after several months of therapy. The concomitant use, however, of colchicine and statin has been associated with the rapid onset of muscle weakness. Four patients with similar clinical and laboratory characteristics to our patient's after the combined use of colchicine and statins have been described in the literature. Patients receiving combination therapy with colchicine and simvastatin, particularly in the presence of renal insufficiency, should be monitored for the development of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.",2007,10
720,1792646,Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia as a complication of methotrexate treatment of asthma.,"A 32 year old man with chronic severe asthma, requiring maintenance oral corticosteroids, was started on a weekly dose of methotrexate. Eleven weeks later he developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. In the two years following treatment there has been no recurrence while oral corticosteroid treatment has been continued. Pneumocystis pneumonia should be considered in asthmatic patients taking methotrexate who present with fever, pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxia.",1991,12
721,17931455,Marrow proliferation as a cause of hearing loss in beta-thalassaemia major.,"The aim of this report was to highlight the fact that hearing loss in thalassaemia patients can be related to marrow expansion affecting the ossicles, resulting in a conductive loss.
A six-year-old boy with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia developed a unilateral hearing loss shortly after commencing desferrioxamine therapy. Ototoxicity was assumed, but the deficit was later found to be of a conductive nature, due to marrow proliferation within the ossicular chain as a consequence of the disease process--a phenomenon previously unreported in the literature.
It is important to elucidate the precise nature of new onset hearing loss in patients receiving iron chelation therapy, in order to avoid unnecessary cessation of much needed medication, on the assumption of ototoxicity.",2008,11
722,17937473,Leflunomide-associated infections in rheumatoid arthritis.,"To determine the prevalence of severe infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) prescribed leflunomide in North Canterbury, New Zealand.
A case-note audit of all Christchurch Hospital patients with RA prescribed leflunomide between 2002 and 2006 was performed. The criterion for severe infection was inpatient hospitalization. Relevant reports to the national Pharmacovigilance Centre were also examined.
Since January 2002, 171 patients with RA have commenced taking leflunomide. Ninety-nine of 171 (57.9%) patients were also prescribed prednisone. Combination disease modifying antirheumatic drug therapy was common, with 82/171 (48.0%) taking methotrexate (MTX), 15/171 (8.8%) hydroxy-chloroquine, 11/171 (6.4%) sulfasalazine, and 8/171 (4.7%) anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. Eleven patients developed infection requiring hospitalization while taking leflunomide including: lower respiratory tract infections (3), cellulitis (2), disseminated herpes zoster (2), probable TB liver (1), abdominal sepsis (1), mycotic aneurysm (1) and gastroenteritis (1). Nine of the 11 patients were also taking corticosteroids or corticosteroids with MTX. The 171 patients were treated for a total of 4005 months, giving an incidence for severe infection of 3.30/100 patient-years (95% CI 1.65-5.90). Patients at increased risk were those with severe disease and taking concomitant MTX and corticosteroids. The NZ Pharmacovigilance Centre has received 7 additional reports of severe infections in patients with RA taking leflunomide. Reported cases include probable pulmonary TB (1), pneumocystis pneumonia (1), other pulmonary infection (2), and septicemia (3) including a case of infective endocarditis. Four occurred in combination with MTX, one with adalimumab. All 5 patients were also taking -corticosteroids.
We believe this observed rate of serious infection is acceptable in the context of optimally treating active RA. Patients with severe disease and taking combination MTX and corticosteroids are at greatest risk. In our experience, once established, infections may rapidly progress in patients with RA taking leflunomide, and early cholestyramine washout is strongly recommended.",2007,11
723,17952482,Sulfasalazine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and hemophagocytic syndrome associated with reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus.,"A 58-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) developed fever, skin eruptions, leukocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia, 3 weeks after treatment with sulfasalazine. A skin biopsy showed hydropic degeneration of keratinocytes and lymphocytic infiltrate. A bone marrow aspiration demonstrated an increased number of macrophages with hemophagocytosis. Although serologic tests for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) indicated a previous infection, EBV deoxyribonucleic acid was detected in her serum by polymerase chain reaction. Cessation of sulfasalazine and administration of steroids led to dramatic improvement. This case illustrates that the hemophagocytic syndrome associated with reactivation of EBV can occur as part of drug hypersensitivity reactions in RA patients taking sulfasalazine.",2008,3
724,17955169,Uncontrolled headache induced by oxcarbazepine.,"Headache induced by acute exposure to a specific drug constitutes an idiosyncratic side effect. Metabolic imbalance appears as the leading aetiology, among several other hypotheses. Either primary headaches show a higher susceptibility to this idiosyncratic reaction or a drug-induced primary headache evolves in intensity and duration, becoming uncontrolled until the complete discontinuation of the drug in consideration. The goal of this study is to describe three patients diagnosed with migraine and epilepsy (both under control) who evolved into status migrainosus after the introduction of oxcarbazepine (OXC), as part of a switch off from carbamazepine (CBZ). Twenty-four to seventy-two hours following the switch, all patients developed intractable headache, despite the use of different symptomatic drugs. Complete recovery of the headache symptoms occurred only after OXC was discontinued. We discuss the potential mechanisms associated to OXC and status migrainosus, drug-induced headaches and uncontrolled headaches.",2007,10
725,17959575,Myoclonus associated with continuous dobutamine infusion in a patient with end-stage renal disease.,"The occurrence of myoclonus associated with continuous i.v. infusion of dobutamine in a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is described.
A 65-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to the hospital on January 26, 2006, for worsening congestive heart failure (CHF). He had been receiving dobutamine 3 mug/kg/min by intermittent i.v. infusion over four hours once weekly as an outpatient. His medical history included ischemic cardiomyopathy, pacemaker placement, ESRD, carotid artery disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Along with receiving multiple other drugs, the patient was started on a continuous i.v. infusion of dobutamine 3 mug/kg/min. On January 29, the patient began having myoclonic muscle spasms. Clonazepam was given as needed, and the patient was discharged on February 1 with myoclonus that soon subsided. On March 13 the patient was again admitted for worsening CHF and was started on continuous dobutamine infusion. He was discharged on March 15; myoclonic muscle spasms began that afternoon. Myoclonic movements were noted when the patient arrived at the outpatient infusion center to begin his intermittent dobutamine infusion, and he was sent to the emergency department, where he was treated with calcium gluconate, regular insulin, and lorazepam and was instructed to stop his potassium supplements; he then received his dobutamine infusion. The myoclonic symptoms continued until March 18, when they subsided.
A patient with CHF and ESRD developed myoclonic muscle spasms after receiving dobutamine by continuous i.v. infusion.",2007,11
726,17965530,Successful treatment of a colonic ulcer penetrating the urinary bladder caused by the administration of calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol.,"A 77-year-old woman was urgently admitted for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis and a duodenal ulcer hemorrhage in March 1999. She had a history of diabetes and angina pectoris. After admission, she received oral calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol to treat hyperkalemia. Nine days later, severe abdominal pain developed. A colonoscopic examination revealed a sigmoid colonic ulcer and stenosis; the patient was treated conservatively. At a 1-year follow-up examination, the colonic stenosis was found have worsened; pneumaturia developed in January 2001. The patient was found to have a sigmoidovesical fistula and underwent sigmoidectomy and partial resection of the ileum and urinary bladder. The histological findings were a benign colonic ulcer with the infiltration of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes. Rhomboidal, dark violet Kayexalate crystals were observed on microscope examination in the submucosa in both the first and second colonic biopsy specimens. We concluded that the colonic ulcer and the sigmoidovesical fistula had been caused by the administration of calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol. Reports of colonic perforation as a result of the administration of calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol are rare. Here, we report the successful treatment of a colonic ulcer that had penetrated the urinary bladder.",2007,10

730,18020545,Tardive oculogyric crisis during treatment with clozapine: report of three cases.,"Tardive oculogyric crisis (OGC) is a dystonic syndrome that starts after long-term use of dopamine receptor antagonists. Atypical antipsychotics have reduced liability for inducing tardive dystonia and show antidystonic properties in patients with pre-existing tardive dystonia. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug, and there have been case reports that clozapine may be an effective treatment for tardive dystonia. Surprisingly, we found that three patients appeared to develop tardive OGC while taking clozapine. The relationship between tardive OGC and clozapine is still unknown. However, it is possible that the previous antipsychotic exposure could have created a sensitising or priming effect on the striatum. Also, there are some suggestions of an underlying susceptibility and possibly a genetic predisposition, at least in some patients.",2007,0

732,18034202,Infection of total hip prosthesis by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium chelonae in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.,"Atypical mycobacterial infections of the musculoskeletal system are very rare and are generally associated with predisposing factors, such as trauma, use of corticosteroids, or an immunocompromised state. There have only been three reports of Mycobacterium chelonae prosthetic infection of which two cases were associated with total hip arthroplasty and one with total knee arthroplasty and no reports of both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. chelonae occurring in the same joint. We report a case of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis treated with low-dose methotrexate (15 mg/week) who developed infection with both M. tuberculosis and M. chelonae after the revision of a prosthetic hip. Joint infections by mycobacteria are clinically indistinguishable from those caused by more common bacterial pathogens and, therefore, diagnosis is often delayed. Recurrent prosthetic hip infections, particularly in immunosuppressive patients, should alert the physician to consider the possibility of both tuberculous and atypical mycobacterial infections. Obtaining appropriate cultures can be critical in making the diagnosis and directing treatment. With the increasing use of immunosuppressive agents, including TNF alpha inhibitors, it is likely that there will be an increase in the number of mycobacterial infections complicating arthroplasties.",2008,4
733,18037876,Sustained ventricular tachycardia in a thalidomide-treated patient with primary plasma-cell leukemia.,"A 68-year-old man diagnosed with primary plasma-cell leukemia was given thalidomide maintenance treatment for his disease. He had previously failed induction therapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone, but achieved complete remission after melphalan therapy. Multiple syncopal episodes started to occur during thalidomide treatment, and a Holter electrocardiogram showed multiple abnormalities, with an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Blood tests, peripheral blood smear, bone-marrow biopsy and aspirate, Holter electrocardiogram.
Sustained ventricular tachycardia possibly owing to thalidomide treatment.
Thalidomide withdrawal, dexamethasone maintenance therapy, monthly oral courses of combined melphalan and prednisone, salvage therapy with bortezomib.",2007,12
734,18042092,Embolia cutis medicamentosa following subcutaneous injection of glatiramer acetate.,"Embolia cutis medicamentosa (ECM) is a rare side effect observed primarily after intramuscular injections. It is associated with localized, sometimes extensive necrosis of the skin. Reflex vasospasm induced by the injection trauma may be etiologically involved. It is a potentially serious reaction which is little influenced by which drug is injected. A patient developed typical ECM after subcutaneous selfinjection of glatiramer acetate for multiple sclerosis. This case is remarkable since 1) ECM developed after subcutaneous and not after intramuscular injection, 2) the injection was given by the patient himself, and 3) glatiramer acetate can induce skin necrosis as a side effect. ECM can be easily differentiated from the latter by its typical clinical features.",2007,12
735,18067642,Histopathology of the thyroid in amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism.,"Amiodarone is well recognized as an anti-arrhythmic drug containing a high dose of iodine with considerable potential to cause thyroid dysfunction. The present patient was a 66-year-old Japanese woman who developed a cardiac arrhythmia and was given amiodarone as an anti-arrhythmic agent for approximately 3 months, until the day before her death. However, 19 days after starting amiodarone, serum testing indicated a hypothyroid status that was not recognized clinically. At autopsy, microscopy showed that most of the thyroid follicles were enlarged with dense colloid substance and lined by flattened follicular cells (involuted follicles). There were a small number of damaged follicles infiltrated by macrophages, which were immunopositive for HAM56. Sudan IV staining indicated many lipid droplets in follicular cells. Ultrastructurally the follicular cells contained large residual bodies composed of abundant electron-lucent lipid droplets of variable size. Although it is difficult to be certain of the direct link of amiodarone on the basis of a single case, it is reasonable to presume that this histopathology is associated with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism and that involution changes represent the hypofunctional status of this drug-induced disorder. This is the first report on the histopathological findings of thyroid tissue from a patient with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism.",2008,1
736,18071101,Quetiapine-induced leucopenia and thrombocytopenia.,"Antipsychotic drugs can cause neutropenia, which can progress to life-threatening agranulocytosis if drug therapy is not interrupted. The newer atypical antipsychotics are reputedly without adverse hematological effects. Quetiapine is a recently introduced atypical antipsychotic. It is a dibenzothiazepine derivative and shows similarities with clozapine in that it is characterized by high 5-HT(2)-relative-to-DA(2) receptor affinity. Although adverse effects are usually mild, the author reports here a case of leucocytopenia and thrombocytopenia with quetiapine treatment that required its discontinuation.",0,0
737,18076602,Amphotericin B-induced cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis: case report.,"A 37-year-old female patient was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 8 months ago and medical treatment with oral azathioprine, low-dose corticosteroids and 5-ASA was started. Following 3 months without any symptoms, the patient had total colectomy and ileostomy. After this period, liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) was given with the diagnosis of probable fungal infection. Palpable purpuric skin lesions on the anterior surface of both legs appeared on the 55th day of amphotericin B treatment. Histological examination of a skin biopsy was consistent with leucocytoclastic vasculitis. We present a case of cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis in which amphotericin B might presumably be the aetiological factor.",2008,1
738,18079582,Transient asymptomatic bradycardia in patients on infusional 5-fluorouracil.,"The incidence of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-related cardiotoxicity seems to be dosage and schedule dependent. Although various other cardiac events have been reported in literature, a series of patients having transient asymptomatic bradycardia has not been reported in the literature as yet. We report such a series of patients who had transient asymptomatic bradycardia after being treated with continuous infusion 5-FU. We plan to do a Holter study during the period of bradycardia in subsequent patients and this may throw more light on the issue.",0,0
739,18094347,Methotrexate-induced papular eruption following treatment of psoriasis.,"To report a case of a diffuse papular eruption following treatment of psoriasis with methotrexate injections.
A 52-year-old woman presented with an extensive flare of psoriasis associated with joint pain, especially in her knees and elbows. She was treated with intramuscular injections of methotrexate 20 mg/wk. Ten hours after the second methotrexate injection, the patient experienced a diffuse pruritic papular eruption located mainly on the limbs. Histology showed foci of dyskeratosis in the mucosal layer and a polymorphic perivascular inflammatory infiltrate of the papillary dermis, suggesting a drug-induced skin reaction. According to the Naranjo probability scale, the papular eruption was probably caused by methotrexate. The drug was discontinued and papular lesions gradually disappeared.
Methotrexate-induced papular eruption is rarely reported shortly after beginning methotrexate therapy in patients with acute exacerbation of collagen vascular diseases. Methotrexate-induced papular eruption following treatment of psoriasis has not been previously reported.
The pathogenesis of methotrexate-induced papular eruption in collagen vascular diseases may suggest cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis. In our patient, histology showed aspects of drug-induced skin reaction without vasculitis. Pathogenesis of methotrexate-induced papular eruption in psoriasis may involve immune mechanisms other than those of methotrexate-induced cutaneous vasculitis in collagen vascular disease.",2008,1
740,1814986,Metabolic acidosis induced by acetazolamide.,"The carbonic anhydrase inhibitors that are used most frequently in ophthalmic practice are acetazolamide and methazolamide. They both are weak systemic diuretics and lower intraocular pressure ultimately by decreasing aqueous production. Unfortunately, they have a number of important side effects including the potentiation or exacerbation of metabolic acidosis. In some patients, this pH shift may be quite transient and temporary; whereas, in some patients with other maladies, the acidosis may be much more serious. The patient herein reported had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and had had a nephrectomy. Close patient monitoring is advisable in these types of patients.",1991,12
741,18160579,Pericardial hemorrhage due to acetylsalicylic acid in a patient with essential thrombocythemia.,"Essential thrombocythemia is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder that causes thrombocytosis. Essential thrombocythemia is characterized by increased incidence of thrombosis with arterial event more than venous events and hemorrhagic complications. Acetylsalicylic acid enhances both minor and major bleedings. The authors describe pericardial hemorrhage, which is related to the use of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid in a patient with essential thrombocythemia. The patient was successfully managed with clopidogrel therapy during the 16 months follow-up without recurrent thrombotic or hemorrhagic events.",0,0
742,18176653,Oral adverse effects due to the use of Nevirapine.,"The aim of this article is to present the clinical characteristics and management of an oral adverse effect stemming from the use of the antiretroviral medication Nevirapine (NVP).
NVP is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.
A 29-year-old black man, HIV-infected since 1996, began highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir. From 1996 to 2002 several medications were changed due to their adverse effects: indinavir (renal colic and fever), nelfinavir (cutaneous rash), and efavirenz (nausea and temporary memory loss). When the patient presented to our service he was taking NVP, zidovudine, and lamivudine. A whitish plaque in the lips and bilateral buccal mucosa, burning, taste disturbance, and xerostomia were observed. The discontinuation of HAART led to the complete resolution of signs and symptoms. The patient has received follow-up treatment for three years and five months without local or systemic effects observed.
Unfortunately, the clinical features of the oral adverse effect from NVP are not well known. This paper contributed to the identification of possible reactions in the oral cavity due to antiretroviral medication. Although HAART is very important in the treatment of HIV, its side effects are responsible for patients' non-adherence to medications. While more studies are needed to better understand the mechanism of action after suspending HAART, the complete resolution of the signs and symptoms was observed. Therefore, physicians and dentists alike must understand how to identify and prevent these adverse effects in order to further improve HIV patient treatments.",2008,1
743,18191947,Conventional and diffusion-weighted MRI findings of methotrexate related sub-acute neurotoxicity.,"We describe longitudinal diffusion-weighted MRI findings of sub-acute leukoencephalopathy following methotrexate therapy in a 24-year-old man diagnosed with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), presenting with right-sided paralysis and aphasia after second consolidation with intrathecal triple-drug therapy given intrathecally. This case demonstrates the value of DWI in evaluation and diagnosis of sub-acute toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients being treated with methotrexate. The longitudinal follow up DWI findings suggest reversible metabolic derangement rather than ischemia as the cause of these findings.",2008,6
744,18203308,New onset of Crohn's disease during treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis with etanercept.,"We describe 3 AS patients treated with etanercept for active AS who developed new onset of CD while AS related symptoms responded well to etanercept. Typical symptoms of active CD occurred 11, 12, and 26 months after start of etanercept therapy, respectively. On colonoscopy, inflammatory lesions highly compatible with CD were found endoscopically and histologically in all patients. Etanercept was stopped, and CD responded well to standard treatment. One of the 3 patients was reexposed to etanercept later on. While the 2 patients without re-exposure to etanercept did not have further CD flares, the third patient flared 6 months after re-institution of etanercept in combination with azathioprine. New onset of CD may be considered as an immune-mediated injury induced by etanercept. Although this is an intriguing hypothesis, any causative role of etanercept remains unproven at this stage.",2008,3
745,18252776,Management of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage complicating dual anti-platelet therapy.,"Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage is a serious complication of aspirin and clopidogrel (dual) anti-platelet therapy with a high morbidity and mortality. Using an illustrative case this article examines the prognostic significance of gastrointestinal haemorrhage and the risk of stopping anti-platelet therapy. The management of this clinical challenge is reviewed, in the absence of a clinical guideline, with particular reference to the judicious tailoring of anti-platelet therapy, the role of therapeutic endoscopy and the utility of blood transfusion.",2008,4
746,18258513,Mediastinal extravasation of doxorubicin.,"A 48-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast carcinoma was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy through a central venous catheter with subcutaneous reservoir (Port-A-Cath). While doxorubicin was administered, the patient presented thoracic pain and breathing distress due to superior vena cava perforation by the central catheter and subsequent extravasation of the drug into the mediastinum. The patient recovered without sequelae with conservative therapy. Cytostatic extravasation via central catheter is an uncommon complication in clinical practice. In this paper we present the first doxorubicin extravasation through a central catheter in adults and review the only ten cases found in the literature.",2008,2
747,1827039,Severe hepatocellular dysfunction following cyproterone acetate therapy.,"Cyproterone acetate (CPA) is a widely used drug in the treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma.

Blood for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA polymerase chain reaction was positive. She was treated with acyclovir and subsequently developed VZV antigen-positive zoster. Detection of VZV DNA in blood may be useful for early diagnosis in immunocompromised hosts who present with zoster without skin lesions.",2008,3
749,18294121,Temozolomide-induced desquamative skin rash in a patient with metastatic melanoma.,"Temozolomide is an oral alkylating agent used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Commonly reported adverse effects of the drug include nausea and vomiting, constipation, headache, and fatigue, as well as myelosuppression, which may be dose limiting. Few reports have described dermatologic adverse effects such as rash and pruritus, and, to our knowledge, none have discussed the seriousness or extensiveness of the rash. We describe a 37-year-old woman who was receiving temozolomide for treatment of metastatic melanoma. After 6 weeks of therapy, the patient developed an unexplained fever. The drug was discontinued, and the fever resolved within 2 days. Temozolomide was restarted 2 months later; the patient again developed a fever. This time the fever was accompanied by a diffuse erythematous skin rash that progressed to an extensive, full-body, desquamative skin rash. The rash was treated with moisturizing cream along with intravenous and topical corticosteroids and antibiotics. Due to the severity of the rash, temozolomide was permanently discontinued. Even after its discontinuation, the patient experienced the rash on a long-term basis, with periodic exacerbations. However, none were as severe as the first rash. The patient's metastatic disease remained stable for the next 2 years. According to the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, the likelihood that temozolomide was responsible for the adverse drug reaction of fever was probable (score of 6). Clinicians should be aware that an erythematous and exfoliative rash may be induced by temozolomide, and be familiar with the pharmacologic and supportive measures necessary for its treatment.",2008,3
750,1829999,Exfoliative dermatitis secondary to tobramycin sulfate.,"We report a case of exfoliative dermatitis clearly linked to intravenous and intraperitoneal administration of tobramycin.

751,18306483,Rituximab-CHOP induced interstitial pneumonitis in patients with disseminated extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma.,"A 69-year-old male was diagnosed in February 2004 with stage IV extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma involving the mediastinal nodes, lung parenchyma and bone marrow with high LDH. Shortness of breath developed following the 5th course of Rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, Doxorubicin, Prednisolone). Bronchoscopy guided transbronchial lung biopsy revealed interstitial thickening and type II pneumocyte activation, compatible with interstitial pneumonitis. After treatment with prednisolone a complete resolution of the dyspnea was observed. The patient was well on routine follow-up at the outpatient clinic, with no progression of lymphoma or interstitial pneumonitis.",2008,2
752,18315788,Phenytoin toxicity: an easily missed cause of cerebellar syndrome.,"We present a series of cases of phenytoin toxicity where the diagnosis was initially missed. These patients all suffered unnecessary morbidity or investigations. The side-effects and unusual pharmacokinetics of phenytoin are discussed, as well as the array of potential drug interactions. We remind clinicians that phenytoin toxicity can easily mimic a cerebellar lesion or alcohol intoxication, and suggest that in accordance with National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines phenytoin should no longer be used as a first-line treatment for epilepsy.",2008,4
753,18343993,Life-threatening interstitial lung disease associated with trastuzumab: case report.,"A female patient with HER2 positive, metastatic breast cancer presented with pulmonary infiltrates, and a plural effusion dyspnoea after several months of trastuzumab treatment. She had been treated without complications with six courses of docetaxel and trastuzumab in combination with dexamethasone with partial remission of disease. Malignancy, infection and cardiomyopathy were excluded as causes of dyspnoea. Pleural and broncheoalveolar fluid analyses (BAL) showed eosinophils. A diagnosis of trastuzumab-induced pneumonitis was made. After treatment with steroids there was gradual clinical improvement and disappearance of infiltrates. Although a causative association between trastuzumab and this patient's pulmonary syndrome was not proven, the potential for this toxicity should be considered.",2009,2
754,1834424,Allergic contact dermatitis from 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan.,"A 30-year-old pharmacist suffered from acute allergic contact dermatitis due to 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD-Cl). Contact allergy towards this reagent and 2 of its reaction products was proven by patch tests. As NBD-Cl has not been reported as an allergen before, the characteristics of this chemical and its use as an analytical reagent are briefly surveyed. Similarities to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) are pointed out.",1991,8
755,18344734,Photo-onycholysis caused by olanzapine and aripiprazole.,"Photo-onycholysis associated with drugs is an uncommon disorder. We report the case of a woman who developed photo-onycholysis on multiple nails after uptake of olanzapine. Substitution of olanzapine with aripiprazole further exacerbated the problem. The possible mechanisms of photo-onycholysis development by modern atypical antipsychotics, modulating dopamine receptors, are discussed.",2008,4
756,18347524,Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage after leflunomide therapy in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.,"We report the case of a young man, affected by rheumatoid arthritis who developed a rapid-onset short-of-breath, hemoptysis, and severe weakness, about 2 weeks after the administration of leflunomide. Chest radiography showed central bilateral opacities and pleural effusion as confirmed by the high-resolution computed tomography that demonstrated diffuse ground-glass and interlobular septal thickening as well. On admission at the Emergency Department, a microhematuria and a severe anemia were also documented. On the basis of the clinico-radiologic presentation, a pulmonary hemorrhage was likely to occur; so to clarify the origin of this process, a complete serologic examination was performed but all the antibodies were negative. Finally a renal biopsy was performed and it showed a pauci-immunologic glomerulonephritis and the bronchioloalveolar lavage confirmed the diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. In conclusion, the diagnosis of leflunomide-pulmonary-renal syndrome was rendered. The treatment with leflunomide was suspended; the conditions of the patient gradually improved and he became completely asymptomatic 1 week later.",2008,2
757,18354950,Hyponatraemia during low-dose carbamazepine therapy.,"We report the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis as a much earlier side-effect of carbamazepine administration in a 29-year Nigerian female patient with generalized tonic-elonic seizures. Although asymptomatic, the biochemical abnormality improved after discontinuation of carbamazepine. Hyponatraemia developed after rechallenge with controlled release carbamazepine. The authors suggest that serum sodium levels be carried out before commencement of carbamazepine and caution be used in prescribing carbamazepine to patients with low or borderline low sodium values.",2007,12
758,18359591,Severe systemic cytomegalovirus infections in patients with steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis treated by an oral microemulsion form of cyclosporine: report of two cases.,"CMV reactivation is frequently observed in acute flares of ulcerative colitis (UC), particularly those which do not respond to intravenous steroids. Several recent series have suggested that, in most cases, CMV reactivation does not lead to severe complications and resolves spontaneously with the UC flare and discontinuation of immunosuppression. In the present paper, we describe two patients with active UC who developed a severe systemic CMV infection during a treatment with an oral microemulsion form of cyclosporine. This is of concern, particularly in a context of increasing use of immunosuppressive drugs in UC. We propose a prophylactic and curative approach to decrease morbidity related to CMV infection in active UC.",2008,5
759,18362995,Imatinib mesylate-related fatal acute hepatic failure in a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia and chronic hepatitis B infection.,"Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is widely-used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumour. Up to four percent of patients treated with imatinib may develop hepatotoxicity, which usually resolves with discontinuation of the drug. We report a 45-year-old Chinese man with CML and chronic hepatitis B virus infection, on imatinib treatment, presenting with herpetic rash and acute liver failure. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenges in the management of such a patient, as well as the need for greater vigilance in the monitoring of liver function tests for patients treated with imatinib. A short review on imatinib-related hepatotoxicity is also presented.",2008,3
760,18364401,Rapidly developing hyperglycemia during treatment with olanzapine.,"To report a case of rapidly occurring hyperglycemia that occurred in a geriatric patient 3 days after treatment with olanzapine.
An 89-year-old man was admitted for dementia with behavioral disturbance and psychosis and was started on olanzapine 2.5 mg twice daily. Due to paranoia and agitation, the dose was increased to 5 mg twice daily after 2 days. Subsequently, he developed hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose 138 mg/dL) that resolved when olanzapine was stopped and recurred (fasting blood glucose 150 mg/dL) after 2 days of rechallenge with olanzapine 2.5 mg twice daily. In addition, his overall medical status worsened, as he developed concurrent acute renal failure and became more confused and lethargic. The hyperglycemia once again resolved with discontinuation of the drug.
We postulate that the rapid onset of hyperglycemia and the resulting medical sequelae were due to olanzapine. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probable. There have been numerous case reports of hyperglycemia with olanzapine in the literature, but none reported hyperglycemia within days of initiation of the medication. Although weight gain often coincides with hyperglycemia in patients taking atypical antipsychotics, it does not seem to be a necessary causal factor. Recent data in animal studies have indicated that olanzapine and clozapine rapidly impair whole-body insulin sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner.
Clinicians treating elderly patients with olanzapine should be aware of the potential for rapidly developing hyperglycemia and monitor such patients accordingly.",2008,4
761,18371508,Adult respiratory distress syndrome after treatment with pegylated interferon alpha-2a and ribavirin.,"Pulmonary manifestations of interferon (IFN) use are a rare but well known complication seen with both standard and pegylated interferon alpha-2b (pegIFNalpha-2b) forms of the agent. These are generally of modest intensity and reversible. We report the first case of fulminant adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with pegylated interferon alpha-2a (pegIFNalpha-2a) and ribavirin use for hepatitis C, complicated by subsequent and ultimately fatal sepsis and multiorgan failure. Practicing gastroenterologists and intensivists alike need to be aware of the potential for serious pulmonary sequelae with the use of combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C viral (CHCV) infections.",0,0

763,18408649,Development of tics in a thirteen-year-old male following atomoxetine use.,"Tics and Tourette syndrome are common comorbidities of patients diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). One of the mainstay pharmacologic therapies for ADHD has been stimulants. However, this class of drugs has been associated with tic exacerbations, thus limiting their utility in this patients subgroup. Atomoxetine has been explored as an alternative treatment as one of the few non-stimulants available to treat ADHD. Early data identifies atomoxetine's influence on Tourette symptomatology to be not merely equivocal but potentially suppressive in the manifestation of tics. There are, however, case studies describing patients experiencing recurrences of tics following treatment with atomoxetine. We present a unique case of a patient, without any prior history of a movement disorder, who developed tics following a single dose of atomoxetine that did not improve until interventional therapy was initiated.",2008,4
764,18421192,Type 1 diabetes mellitus provoked by peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin treatment for chronic hepatitis C.,"A 51-year-old man developed type 1 diabetes mellitus following 24 weeks of treatment with recombinant alpha-2b peginterferon plus ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C. Pancreatic autoantibody tests were negative before the start of therapy, but a significant increase in glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody titer was seen after 24 weeks of treatment. Six months after the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus, the patient continues to receive 40 units of insulin daily. The clinical course suggested that recombinant alpha-2b peginterferon plus ribavirin provoked type 1 diabetes mellitus, therefore, in patients who are candidates for interferon therapy the presence of pancreatic autoantibodies and the fasting plasma glucose level should be investigated before and during treatment.",2008,0
765,18425523,Persisent ocular hypertension following intravitreal ranibizumab.,"To describe the occurrence of ocular hypertension in four patients following injection of ranibizumab intravitreally.
Case series.
Four patients had high intraocular pressure after intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg. Ocular hypertension occurred 1 month after the second ranibizumab injection in patients 1 and 3, and 1 month after the first ranibizumab in patient 2. In patient 4, it occurred several hours after the first ranibizumab injection. In all patients, the IOP increase was sustained across several visits, requiring control with topical glaucoma therapy, and in two cases the addition of a systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. None of the patients had a previous history of glaucoma, ocular hypertension or IOP asymmetry and the IOP was as high as 30, 34, 46, and 50 mmHg in the four patients.
Severe and sustained ocular hypertension may occur after intravitreal ranibizumab. Although the mechanism of the pressure rise is unknown, all eyes in our series were controlled with medical therapy.",2008,7
766,18431096,Methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine-induced peripheral vasculopathy.,"Methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine are central nervous system stimulants used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders in children. These medications have been associated with cerebral arteritis, renal necrotizing vasculitis, and systemic and pulmonary hypertension. We report 4 patients, 2 on methylphenidate and 2 on dextroamphetamine who presented with acral cyanosis, livedo reticularis, or Raynaud phenomenon. Two patients were found to have a positive ANA at low titers, 1 of whom had histopathologic evidence of stratum malgiphian necrosis with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration on skin biopsy. Two had positive antihistone antibodies. One patient improved after withdrawal of dextroamphetamine; others had worsening of their symptoms on higher doses of medications. These cases indicate the potential for development of acral cyanosis, livedo reticularis, or Raynaud symptoms with these medications and their potential contribution to a vasculopathy.",2008,2

In this study, we present a 75-year-old woman who had five children. Gastric tumor, endometrial carcinoma and cervical adenocarcinoma in situ were detected after treatment with tamoxifen for breast cancer. It seems that being aware of the undesirable affects of tamoxifen treatment during the chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy period is very important.",2008,0
769,18465737,Incomplete posterior hyaloid detachment after intravitreal pegaptanib injection in diabetic macular edema.,"Posterior hyaloid adherences play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic macular edema (DME). Intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs are presently being used to treat DME. The authors report one case of incomplete posterior hyaloid detachment (PHD) following intravitreal pegaptanib to treat DME. This case shows a combined mechanism of DME resolution by anti VEGF and PHD.
Prospective, interventional, single case report. One male patient with bilateral DME was treated by intravitreal pegaptanib in his right eye every 6 weeks for 6 months (five injections) and followed for 42 months.
Central macular thickness decreased from 511 to 376 microm at month 4 in the treated eye and remained within 10% of this value during follow-up. The posterior hyaloid became taut and partially detached after the third injection and was almost completely detached 1 year later. Visual acuity remained unchanged in both eyes during follow-up.
PHD may play an important role in cases where macular thickness is successfully reduced or better acuity is achieved after intravitreal injections.",0,0

771,18476934,Transient bilateral blindness and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: a rare complication of enuresis treatment.,"Enuresis is a common paediatric problem which is sometimes treated with anticholinergic drugs. We report a 4-year-old girl who presented with acute bilateral blindness, a focal seizure and hypertension 10 days after commencing oxybutynin to treat enuresis. Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed features of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, a recognised but rare complication of hypertension in children. Discontinuing the oxybutynin leads to complete neurological recovery associated with normalisation of her blood pressure. We believe this case represents a rare complication of anticholinergic therapy. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a treatable and reversible cause of acute encephalopathy with blindness, as long as an early diagnosis is made.",2008,6
772,18487000,Severe symptomatic hyponatremia during sibutramine therapy: a case report.,"Sibutramine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, currently is used in treatment of obesity. The known side effects of sibutramine, ie, hypertension and tachycardia, depend on its adrenergic and serotoninergic effects. We describe a case of life-threatening hyponatremia associated with sibutramine use in an obese woman. We hypothesize that sibutramine, through its effect on neurotransmitters, may induce antidiuretic hormone secretion and lead to a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. We advise careful monitoring of water-electrolytic balance during sibutramine therapy.",2008,7
773,18492617,Pregabalin-induced cortical negative myoclonus in a patient with neuropathic pain.,"Myoclonus is a well-known side effect of anticonvulsant drugs. Pregabalin is one of the newer drugs approved for the treatment of focal epilepsies. Frequently it is also used to treat chronic pain syndromes. We describe a patient who, after receiving his first dose of pregabalin to relieve neuropathic pain, presented with a negative myoclonus. Clinical aspects and electrophysiological data such as polygraphic studies, electroencephalography, and measurement of somatosensory evoked potentials support the cortical origin of negative myoclonus. Our findings reveal that even in patients without a history of seizures, pregabalin can cause a cortical negative myoclonus.",2008,8
774,1849334,Muzolimine-induced severe neuromyeloencephalopathy: report of seven cases.,"We report on 7 patients (2 women, 5 men) with chronic renal failure, who developed under a high dosage of the new diuretic muzolimine (range 240 to 1440 mg per day) fatal neuromyeloencephalopathy. Clinical neurophysiological and neuroradiological findings and finally neuropathological studies in 2 patients resembled those found in vitamin-B12-deficiency-syndrome with a predominant affection of the spinal posterior column and the corticospinal tracts. The first neurological symptoms like paraesthesia, severe hyperpathia of the legs and mild to heavy spinal ataxia occurred after an average time of treatment of 78 days and a mean dosage of 52 g. The most progressive neurological deficits like severe tetraspastic paresis, were seen only in the nondialytic renal insufficient group (3 patients), while the others had a more benign course of the disease. This lead to the hypothesis of a partially dialysable toxic metabolite of muzolimine. After a follow-up of more than 2 1/2 years no significant recovery was seen in these cases.",1991,1
775,18504683,L-asparaginase-induced posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome during acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment in children.,"L-asparaginase is a critical component in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children. It is known to cause coagulation abnormalities, thrombosis and hemorrhage in the central nervous system in addition to vasculitis and hypersensitivity reactions. The purpose of this article is to present the first case-series of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) associated with L-asparaginase treatment. We report 3 cases of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed seizures and altered sensorium after L-asparaginase therapy. MRI showed increased T(2) signal intensity predominant in the posterior regions of the brain suggestive of PRES. Two of our patients developed septic shock and deteriorated whereas one patient improved and recovered completely.",2008,2
776,18515982,Anastrozole-associated sclerosing glomerulonephritis in a patient with breast cancer.,"Anastrozole is a selective aromatase inhibitor and is used for the hormonal treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer. There are major side effects of anastrozole including decrease in both lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density, increase in the incidence of all bone fractures (especially fractures of spine, hip and wrist), joint disorders and increase in the cholesterol level.
We report a case of a 73-year-old postmenopausal woman with stage T2N0M0 breast cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy was not indicated and anastrozole hormonotherapy was started. Diagnosis of sclerosing glomerulonephritis occurred in this patient during anastrozole use, suggesting a newly defined side effect of anastrozole.
Renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for anastrozole, clearance of anastrozole is unchanged even in severe renal impairment. Dosing adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary for anastrozole. We believe that the acute renal failure in our patient was associated with anastrozole. Renal injury due to anastrozole has not been published in the English literature.
Anastrozole may be the causative factor in patients with sclerosing glomerulonephritis.",2007,0
777,18523232,Fatal hepatitis after long-term pulse itraconazole treatment for onychomycosis.,"To report the occurrence of acute cytolytic hepatitis in a patient exposed to pulse itraconazole therapy for 24 weeks and provide a concise review of the literature on cases of itraconazole-induced hepatitis.
A 61-year-old woman with no apparent risk factors for liver injury developed acute hepatitis one week after the final dose of a long-term course of pulse itraconazole therapy (200 mg orally twice daily, 1 wk on, 3 wk off, for 24 wk) for onychomycosis. Monitoring of liver enzymes was not performed during the treatment period. Serologic evaluations on presentation ruled out infectious diseases or other etiological factors. Liver function tests showed alanine aminotransferase 3330 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 3250 U/L, and bilirubin 21 mg/dL. Liver function continued to deteriorate, and the patient underwent liver transplantation 17 days after admission. Her liver displayed reduced volume and there was a mild accumulation of ascitic fluid in the retroperitoneal cavity. Histologic evaluation showed massive panlobular necrosis. Complications occurred after transplantation and a rejection crisis worsened the clinical picture until the patient died about 4 months later. Use of the Naranjo probability scale showed the relationship of itraconazole therapy and the occurrence of acute hepatitis as probable.
Itraconazole pulse therapy for onychomycosis appears to be at least as effective as and safer than a continuous treatment regimen, particularly from the perspective of potential liver damage. Only one case of severe symptomatic hepatitis occurring after pulse therapy with itraconazole for onychomycosis and requiring transplantation has been reported previously. In that case, as well as the one reported here, hepatitis symptoms occurred after completion of long-term treatment in patients who were asymptomatic both before and during therapy.
Prolonged exposure to itraconazole, administered either continuously or intermittently, may precipitate severe and irreversible hepatotoxic events. Accordingly, careful monitoring of liver function parameters should be performed both during and after treatment when onychomycosis requires prolonged itraconazole administration, even in asymptomatic patients lacking apparent risk factors of hepatic injury.",2008,7
778,18533420,Sexual dysfunction associated with intrathecal baclofen use: a report of two cases.,"Intrathecal baclofen is considered standard treatment for severe spasticity of spinal cord and cerebral origin. Recognized side effects include fatigue and constipation. There are few reported findings of sexual dysfunction in men and none in women.
Two case reports.
A male and a female patient with spasticity treated with intrathecal baclofen were recognized to have sexual dysfunction side effects from treatment. On reduction of the intrathecal baclofen dose, complete return to baseline sexual function was achieved for both subjects.
Intrathecal baclofen can impair sexual function and ejaculation in some patients. Clinicians should be aware of this risk and ask about it during routine clinic follow-up for spasticity. Dosing adjustments need to be considered in these patients.",2008,0

Serious allergic reactions related to Increlex therapy have not been reported. We report a 13 year-old male who developed life-threatening anaphylaxis early in the course of Increlex therapy.",2008,4
780,18562412,Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements during sleep probably associated with olanzapine.,"We report five cases of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS) that were probably associated with olanzapine. The first patient showed a good response to olanzapine, but the RLS symptoms associated with olanzapine resulted in poor long-term compliance, eventually leading to frequent relapse of psychotic symptoms. The second patient exhibited sudden PLMS following olanzapine injection. The third patient had been suffering from serious akathisia while on risperidone, and was cured after switching to olanzapine, but thereafter the patient suffered from RLS at nighttime. The fourth patient showed RLS symptoms that were initially caused by a 20-mg daily olanzapine dosage and were later mitigated when olanzapine was reduced and ropinirole was administered. The fifth patient exhibited paraesthesia and agitation caused by olanzapine that was misdiagnosed as psychotic agitation. Increasing the olanzapine dosage severely aggravated the symptoms of RLS. Antipsychotic-induced RLS and PLMS are not well-recognized side effects of antipsychotics, with the symptoms often misdiagnosed as psychotic agitation. These cases also suggest that the occurrence of RLS can cause noncompliance with antipsychotics in psychiatric patients, and thus aggravate their psychotic symptoms.",2009,7
781,18569796,Nodular scleritis following alendronate therapy.,"To report a case of nodular scleritis following alendronate sodium.
A 54 year-old male was treated with alendronate sodium 70 mg orally once per week. Eight weeks later, he experienced pain and redness of the right eye. Biomicroscopy was performed.
Patient was found to have inferonasal nodular scleritis. Laboratory work-up was unrevealing. Patient was given 4 mg of subtenon's triamcinolone acetate in the area of the nodular scleritis and had complete resolution. Two weeks following rechallenge with alendronate sodium resulted in recurrence of his scleritis.
Alendronate led to nodular scleritis and rechallenge caused recurrence of scleritis.",0,0
782,18580694,Tardive seizure and antibiotics: case reports and review of the literature.,"Tardive seizure is a serious adverse reaction of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, it was rarely reported in ECT sessions for psychiatric patients who needed concurrent antibiotic treatments. We present 2 cases of patients with schizophrenia who manifested a catatonic syndrome and were indicated for ECT, along with antibiotic therapies for infectious diseases with piperacillin and cefotiam, respectively. The beta-lactam antibiotics are reported to induce convulsions caused by the suppression of inhibitory GABAergic functions. In addition, there is a report on prolonged ECT seizure related to ciprofloxacin, which has an epileptogenic property with a similar action to beta-lactam antibiotics. Thus, tardive seizures in our cases are thought to be related to piperacillin and cefotiam.",2008,12
783,18585545,Levofloxacin-induced delirium with psychotic features.,"To raise awareness of a rare but serious adverse effect of a commonly used medication.
Report of a case.
A previously healthy 42-year-old woman presented with acute-onset delirium with psychotic features as a consequence of levofloxacin therapy. Withdrawal of the medication was associated with return of the patient's normal mental status.
The new quinolone derivatives (levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin), also called gyrase inhibitors, are known for their potential to cause central nervous system-related adverse effects, including headache, dizziness and insomnia. Risk factors for neurotoxicity include renal insufficiency, underlying central nervous system (CNS) disease and increased CNS penetration of drug. Acute delirium resulting from levofloxacin therapy is an exceedingly rare complication that has been thought to occur more commonly in elderly patients. Here, we describe levofloxacin-induced delirium with psychotic features in a relatively young, otherwise healthy female.",0,0
784,18607107,Development of Crohn's disease in a patient with multiple sclerosis treated with copaxone.,"Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) is a synthetic copolymer mimicking a portion of myelin basic protein, one of several putative autoantigens in multiple sclerosis (MS). Copaxone suppresses the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, a key mediator of inflammation in MS as well as in other pathologies, such as colitis of interstitial bowel disease (IBD). Copaxone is a drug approved for the treatment of MS, and one that is very well tolerated with a high safety profile and relatively few side effects. Crohn's disease has not been associated with its administration.
We describe a patient with MS in remission who had not exhibited any signs of IBD in the past. She had been on Copaxone 20 mg/day treatment for 2 years when she first exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms.
Our patient developed Crohn's disease while on Copaxone treatment as a consequence of long-term immunosuppression.
Clinicians should be aware that Crohn's disease is a potential novel adverse drug effect of Copaxone.",2008,0
785,1860779,Drug induced suicidal ideation.,"The authors present a case study of a mentally healthy man who repeatedly experienced short-lived, obsessional-like suicidal ideas and images after ingestion of the anti-fungal drug ketoconazole. Ego-alien, suicidal ideas are an extremely rare form of adverse drug reaction. This is probably the first report of drug-induced ego-dystonic, mood incongruent suicidal ideas appearing in a fully conscious, healthy individual.",1991,0
786,18609153,Terlipressin-induced ventricular arrhythmia.,"During intravenous treatment with terlipressin for recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, a 50-year-old male with no history of heart disease developed a newly prolonged QT interval and torsade de pointes. Risk factors present for acquired long QT syndrome were mineral dysbalance and a history of alcohol abuse with hepatic impairment. The patient was brought back to a normal sinus rhythm after a single 300-J counter-shock. Terlipressin was discontinued, and the patient's QTc interval subsequently returned to baseline. During 6 weeks of monitoring, arrhythmia did not recur.",2008,0
787,18622319,Spontaneous nasal septal perforation with antiangiogenic bevacizumab therapy.,"Otolaryngologists should be made aware of a newer cause of nasal septal perforations resulting from the more recent antiangiogenic therapy used to treat malignancies. This case describes a 52-year-old white woman who developed a spontaneous nasal septal perforation after given the antiangiogenic drug, bevacizumab, for metastatic ovarian cancer treatment. Bevacizumab is a recently developed monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor used to inhibit angiogenesis. The patient was ultimately treated with a nasal septal button with good symptom relief. This case documents the first report in the otolaryngology literature describing this new etiology for nasal septal perforations.",2008,9
788,18628507,Angio-oedema as an unusual tolerable side effect of voriconazole therapy.,"Voriconazole (VRC) has not previously been reported to cause angio-oedema. Here, we report a case of angio-oedema associated with VRC therapy. A 37-year-old woman with relapsing invasive vertebral aspergillosis received intravenous VRC and developed angio-oedema 10 days after starting therapy. This condition rapidly diminished after administration of intravenous antihistaminics and did not necessitate cessation of VRC treatment. The treatment was continued for 6 months without recurrence of the symptoms. After 18 months, the patient was in good health. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an angio-oedema associated with VRC.",2008,8
789,18633310,Multiple seizures after bupropion overdose in a small child.,"Unintentional ingestion of bupropion in young children has generally resulted in limited toxicity. We report a case of pediatric bupropion ingestion resulting in multiple seizures. The patient experienced hallucinations, agitation, vomiting, tachycardia and seizures after ingestion of 1050 (48 mg/kg) of extended-release bupropion. The potential for severe toxicity in the setting of pediatric overdose should be recognized.",2008,7

791,18648015,Cephalosporin-induced leukopenia following rechallenge with cefoxitin.,"To describe a case of cefazolin-induced leukopenia in a critically ill patient who developed this adverse reaction upon rechallenge with cefoxitin.
A 22-year-old male was admitted after a motor vehicle crash. beta-Lactam therapy was initiated with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole and, upon identification of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia 4 days later, therapy was narrowed to cefazolin 1 g every 12 hours. The dose was adjusted to 1 g every 12 hours during continuous venovenous hemodialysis. Imipenem was given for 2 days, resulting in a total of 18 days of beta-lactam treatment, at which time he developed significant leukopenia (white blood cell [WBC] count 0.9 x 10(3)/microL). Antimicrobial treatment was changed to tigecycline and continued for suspected pleural space infection. The patient's WBC count recovered within 4 days after the change in therapy. He was taken to surgery 8 days after cefazolin was discontinued and received perioperative prophylaxis with cefoxitin (total dose 3 g). Subsequently, the patient again became severely leukopenic (WBC count 2.4 x 10(3)/microL). Within a week after surgery, the patient developed septic shock secondary to multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli bacteremia and died.
beta-Lactam-induced leukopenia is a rare but well-described adverse drug reaction. It is a cumulative dose-dependent phenomenon reported to occur most often after 2 weeks of therapy. The mechanism of leukopenia is thought to be secondary to either an immune-mediated response or direct bone marrow toxicity. Rechallenge with a different beta-lactam antibiotic has not been shown to consistently cause recurrent leukopenia. The case described here suggests an immune-related mechanism for the development of leukopenia. Use of the Naranjo probability scale determined the association between cephalosporin use and leukopenia to be probable.
Cefazolin was a probable cause of this patient's leukopenia. It is important for clinicians to recognize beta-lactam-induced leukopenia and maybe recommend use of a drug from a different antibiotic class if continued treatment is indicated.",2008,9
792,18661248,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) induced by cyclosporine use in a patient with collapsing focal glomeruloesclerosis.,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is characterized by abnormalities in cerebral white matter and neurologic symptoms. It can be caused by immunosuppressive drugs or autoimmune diseases. We describe a case of PRES in a patient with collapsing focal glomeruloesclerosis (collapsing FGS) with complete recovery after withdrawal of cyclosporine (CSA).
A 27-year-old male presented a corticosteroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome secondary to collapsing FGS corticosteroid. Treatment with CSA was started after a nonresponding course of prednisone. Three weeks later, he developed an abrupt elevation of blood pressure (210/120 mmHg), with headaches, mental confusion, and generalized seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lesions suggestive of PRES. CSA was withdrawn, and a new MRI was normal after 2 months.
PRES is a rare syndrome that must be suspected in every patient presenting neurologic symptoms in the course of immunosuppression. It can be induced by CSA and is totally reversible when the drug is rapidly withdrawn.",2008,0
793,18665833,Stuttering priapism complicating warfarin therapy in a patient with protein C deficiency.,"Priapism is a rare disorder defined as a persistent penile erection that continues hours beyond, or is unrelated to, sexual stimulation. There are two types of priapism; ischemic low-flow type or non-ischemic high flow, with differing etiologies. Priapism associated with thrombophilia is a well-recognized entity. However, the pathogenesis of this association is not fully understood. We report a rare case of recurrent (stuttering) priapism in a patient with protein C deficiency while maintained on Warfarin therapy. This therapy was also complicated by Warfarin-induced skin necrosis.",2008,8
794,18672645,A case of ovarian endodermal sinus tumor diagnosed during pregnancy.,"Pregnancy complicated by endodermal sinus tumor of the ovary is extremely rare. The authors present a case report of a pregnant woman with persistent left adnexal mass and subsequently found to have a primary endodermal sinus tumor of the ovary that was diagnosed at 19 weeks of gestation. After left salpingo-oophorectomy had been performed, the patient chose to terminate the pregnancy before the initiation of combination chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin. The response to chemotherapy was not satisfactory. The patient expired after seven cycles of treatment had been completed because of pulmonary fibrosis and the drug toxicity of bleomycin.",2008,5
795,18675768,Adverse effects of propafenone after long-term therapy with the addition of citalopram.,"Propafenone, a class IC antiarrhythmic, and citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), are widely used in older patients. Although a potential interaction between propafenone and SSRIs has been noted, a MEDLINE search revealed no published reports of an interaction between propafenone and citalopram.
The goal of this article was to describe a potential drug-drug interaction between propafenone and citalopram, which caused symptoms of propafenone adverse effects.
An 80-year-old white female, followed up at the Memory Clinic for mild cognitive impairment, had been taking propafenone 900 mg/d for >10 years for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without adverse effects. Three months after starting citalopram, she experienced episodes of chest tightness and dizziness. The episodes became more frequent in the following months, causing several falls and requiring visits to the emergency department, but no acute coronary event was diagnosed. She was started on amlodipine 2.5 mg orally once daily, a nitroglycerin patch (0.4 mg/h), and warfarin 5 mg orally once daily. After one fall, the patient became delirious. Amlodipine and the nitroglycerin patch were discontinued and propafenone decreased to 450 mg/d; citalopram was continued at 20 mg/d. The patient recovered well, both cognitively and physically, and did not have any further symptoms in 1 year of follow-up. Results of coronary investigations were negative.
This is the first report of a possible interaction between propafenone and citalopram, which caused propafenone adverse effects (eg, dizziness, falls) and mimicked coronary artery disease.",2008,6
796,18682542,Neuralgic amyotrophy associated with antibiotic therapy.,"To report a case of neuralgic amyotrophy associated with antibiotic therapy.
A 22-year-old male with cystic fibrosis had been nonadherent to treatment for 4 years; when he returned to the clinic with symptoms, his forced expiratory volume in 1 second dropped from 84% predicted to 43% predicted. He was admitted to the hospital for treatment after failing to improve on oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled tobramycin. Treatment was initiated with intravenous tobramycin 560 mg daily and piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g infused every 6 hours. He continued inhaled tobramycin 300 mg twice daily, his home doses of pancreatic replacement enzymes and vitamins, albuterol 2.5 mg by high flow nebulizer (HFN) 4 times daily, and dornase alpha 2.5 by HFN daily. Sputum cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 8 hours was added to the treatment regimen on hospital day 7. The patient developed bilateral shoulder pain followed by decreased function of his upper extremities 2 days later. He was treated with oral ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 h and oral cyclobenzaprine 5 mg daily, which improved his pain, but the shoulder stiffness remained throughout his hospital stay and persisted for 2 months following discharge. These symptoms resolved but recurred rapidly (within 24 h) and were more debilitating following a second exposure to the same antibiotics at the same doses 8 months later when the patient was readmitted for treatment of another cystic fibrosis-related pulmonary exacerbation.
To our knowledge, this is the first case report illustrating neuralgic amyotrophy triggered by exposure to the antibiotics vancomycin, tobramycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. After analysis of the case, ruling out other possibilities and using the Naranjo probability scale, we found that there is a highly probable likelihood that the symptoms presented by our patient were secondary to his drug therapy. Neuralgic amyotrophy is a rare condition of unknown etiology that has never before been associated with administration of these antibiotics, individually or in combination. Because of the specifics of the clinical history, we were unable to ascertain whether this complication was due to a single antibiotic or to the combination. It is quite possible that vancomycin was the only culprit, but impossible to ensure with the available evidence.
Clinicians should be aware of this adverse reaction when facing similar complex neurologic symptoms in patients who are receiving the antibiotic treatment described here, especially vancomycin.",2008,9
797,1868481,Seizures and transient blindness following intravenous pulse methylprednisolone in children with primary glomerulonephritis.,"Two children, 1 with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome and 1 with endo-extracapillary glomerulonephritis, presented an episode of seizures and transient blindness at different times after i.v. pulse methylprednisolone (IVPMP) treatment. Neurological manifestations in patient 1 could be due to hypertension secondary to IVPMP, while the pathogenesis of such manifestations remained difficult to clarify in patient 2. The severity of uremia in patient 2 could be one of the conditions that, in association with the abrupt changes obtained with IVPMP, predispose to neurological manifestations. Careful clinical and biochemical monitoring seems necessary in children with primary glomerulonephritis, other than those transplanted, after IVPMP, and factors predisposing to neurologic sequelae should be further defined.",1991,0
798,18691992,Hydroxyurea associated with concomitant occurrence of diffuse longitudinal melanonychia and multiple squamous cell carcinomas in an elderly subject.,"Hydroxyurea is a cytostatic agent used to treat myeloproliferative disorders and long-term treatment is associated with mucocutaneous adverse events and nail hyperpigmentation.
The purpose of this study was to report the concomitant occurrence of multiple squamous cell carcinomas and diffuse nail hyperpigmentation associated with hydroxyurea treatment, and to describe a successful therapeutic approach using imiquimod 5%.
We report the case of an 81-year-old white man (weight, 82 kg; height, 173 cm; photodamaged type II skin) affected with cirrhosis of the liver, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, and a 3-year history of longitudinal melanonychia and periungual hyperpigmentation. His current medication regimen was hydroxyurea (500 mg BID), iron (525 mg QD), and folic acid (15 mg QD) for the myeloproliferative disease and the associated anemia; spironolactone (25 mg BID) and furosemide (20 mg BID) for the complications of cirrhosis; allopurinol (100 mg QD) to treat gout; and theophylline (250 mg QD) for chronic bronchitis. The patient presented with several actinic keratoses, squamous cell carcinomas, and multiple keratoacanthomas, one of which was pigmented. Both the longitudinal melanonychia and the multiple skin cancers first appeared after approximately 6 months of hydroxyurea treatment. A correlation between dose and manifestation was investigated but none was found. Based on the Naranjo algorithm, the adverse reaction observed was probably related to the hydroxyurea treatment (score = 6); however, the hydroxyurea chemotherapy could not be discontinued because of the myeloproliferative disorder. Complete remission was observed after 6 to 10 weeks of imiquimod 5% (10 mg/cm of skin cancer) treatment. The patient completed a 10-month follow-up, maintaining a complete resolution of the treated skin lesions; however, the development of a painful hand ulcer, possibly associated with the hydroxyurea, and new skin cancers were observed at the last follow-up visit.
We report this case of the concomitant appearance of multiple skin cancers and nail changes associated with hydroxyurea use. The progressive appearance of squamous epitheliomas and other cutaneous adverse events, such as the ulcer, suggests that alternative chemotherapies should be considered for the treatment of myeloproliferative diseases.",2008,7

Vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS) is a rare cause of progressive cholestasis. Both syndromes are mostly related with drugs. We report a case of a patient with ciprofloxacin-induced SJS and acute onset of VBDS, and reviewed the related literature. It is the first case of ciprofloxacin-induced VBDS successfully treated with tacrolimus. This case reminds physicians of the importance of drug reactions, their severity, techniques for diagnosis and methods of management.",2008,8

802,18717612,Ceftriaxone-induced fixed drug eruption: first report.,"Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is an unusual type of cutaneous adverse drug reaction that is characterized by recurrent site-specific lesions each time the drug responsible is taken. FDE from cephalosporins has been rarely reported, and to the best of our knowledge there is no published report of ceftriaxone-induced FDE in the literature. We report the first case of a 54-year-old Turkish woman who presented with ceftriaxone-induced FDE. Topical provocation with ceftriaxone sodium salt (1% in water [aq.], 5% aq., 10% in petrolatum [pet.], 20% pet.) remained negative both at previously affected sites and in the unaffected skin of the back. Therapeutic re-exposure with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g confirmed the diagnosis. The patient tolerated amoxicillin and cefazolin, suggesting that the sensitizing portion was not the beta-lactam ring. Identification of the antigenic determinants of FDE-inducing drugs will make predicting safe alternatives in patients with FDE an easier task.",2008,0

Gabapentin is widely used in the management of pain. It is entirely excreted through the renal system so this needs to be considered in any patient becoming acutely ill and developing renal failure. We describe a patient who developed significant deterioration in her conscious level due to iatrogenic gabapentin overdose.
All doctors need to be aware of the need to review the indications for gabapentin use during periods of acute illness, especially with regard to renal impairment. Off-label use should be discouraged.",2009,1

Case report.
Two patients with ocular inflammation of unknown origin developed severe chorioretinitis after IVTA injection. Multiple retinal infiltrates, placoid subretinal lesions, and ground-glass opacity of the retina with hyperemic optic discs were observed in both patients. The etiology of the chorioretinitis was confirmed by serology to be syphilis. Appropriate treatment for neurosyphilis was instituted. Both eyes became atrophied and had poor visual outcome: 10/200 in one patient and no light perception in the other at 6 months after IVTA injection.
The fundus picture shown in these cases may be typical of ASPPC after IVTA injection. Clinical suspicion of ASPPC upon observation of these characteristic features is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment.",2008,12
805,18755414,Hemorrhage from a falx meningioma after internal use of low-dose aspirin.,"We report a case in which hemorrhage occurred in an asymptomatic falx meningioma known beforehand, after the internal use of low-dose aspirin for 16 months. Our case is the second one in which hemorrhage from a meningioma may have been induced by aspirin prophylaxis. On the other hand, aspirin may have promoted the enlargement of spontaneous hemorrhage from meningioma. Furthermore, inadequate control of hypertension may have been another cause of hemorrhage. Although it is difficult to solely attribute intratumoral hemorrhage to aspirin, we have to be careful when prescribing aspirin for patients who have asymptomatic meningioma.",2008,9
806,18765315,Acute coronary syndromes complicating the first infusion of rituximab.,"The aim of this study was to describe the occurrence of acute coronary syndromes in 3 cases of rituximab infusions. We reviewed the records of 3 patients with lymphoproliferative disorders who experienced acute coronary syndromes associated with their initial infusion of rituximab. All 3 patients received rituximab according to a standardized institutional rate schedule, and all received pre-medication with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. The median age of patients was 61 years. One patient had known atherosclerotic heart disease, and 2 patients had risk factors for coronary artery disease. All patients had varying degrees of evidenced high tumor burden, including lymphocytosis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase values, bulky tumor masses, and bone marrow involvement by lymphoma. All 3 patients experienced fairly typical chest pain syndromes and experienced elevations of cardiac enzymes consistent with myocardial ischemia. One patient died of an arrhythmia that deteriorated into asystole, and 2 patients recovered and underwent coronary angiography. Acute coronary syndromes can be associated with the infusion of rituximab. Patients with a history of previous coronary artery disease or risk factors for coronary artery disease should be observed closely for signs of myocardial ischemia, particularly during the initial infusion. The occurrence of symptoms that could be ascribed to an acute coronary syndrome should always be taken seriously during the first rituximab infusion and investigated aggressively. Patients should be aware that this is a rare, albeit serious, complication of treatment with rituximab.",2008,8
807,18775393,Laryngeal dyspnea in relation to an interaction between acenocoumarol and topical econazole lotion.,"Bleeding is the most serious complication of oral anticoagulant therapy used for the prevention of thromboembolic complications. Drug-drug interactions are an important concern, as they may increase drug toxicity and, in the case of anticoagulant therapies, increase the risk of hemorrhage.
An 84-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a bilateral cervical hematoma and symptoms of upper-airway obstruction that had been increasing for 72 hours, with dyspnea and difficulty speaking developing in the previous 24 hours. Transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a significant laryngeal hematoma, as well as a hematoma on the floor of the mouth and in the tonsil area. Laboratory abnormalities included a prothrombin time < 10%, an international normalized ratio exceeding the laboratory limits, and an activated partial thromboplastin time >120 seconds. The patient had been receiving acenocoumarol 4 mg/d for 10 years for episodes of atrial fibrillation and recurrent deep venous thrombosis. Seventeen days earlier, she had received a prescription for topical econazole lotion 1% to be applied 3 times daily for 1 month to treat a dermatitis affecting 12% of the body surface. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment of respiratory failure, where oxygen was delivered by face mask. The coagulation disorders were treated with prothrombin complex concentrate 30 IU/kg IV and vitamin K1 10 mg IV, and values normalized within 36 hours. Surgical evacuation of the laryngeal hematoma was not necessary. After 48 hours, improvement in the patient's respiratory symptoms allowed transfer to the ear, nose, and throat unit, where daily endoscopic examination was performed. Aspirin was substituted for acenocoumarol, and the patient returned home after 10 days without sequelae. Based on a Naranjo score of 7, this episode was probably related to an interaction between acenocoumarol and econazole.
This report describes a case of a probable interaction between topical econazole lotion 1% and acenocoumarol that resulted in overanticoagulation and a life-threatening laryngeal hematoma in this elderly patient.",2008,8
808,18784429,High-dose methylprednisolone in a pregnant woman with Crohn's disease and adrenal suppression in her newborn.,"The synthetic corticosteroid methylprednisolone is used for the treatment of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease, also in pregnancy. Its use is considered to be less harmful than the effect of active disease on the fetus. Adrenal suppression in a fetus due to administration of methylprednisolone has hitherto been rarely published.
To present a case of neonatal adrenal suppression due to the use of high-dose methylprednisolone in late pregnancy of a woman with Crohn's disease.
Clinical signs of adrenal suppression were observed in the newborn 3 h after birth. After hydrocortisone supplementation and intensive therapy the baby recovered completely.
Life-threatening adrenal suppression, requiring hydrocortisone supplementation and intensive therapy, was observed and successfully treated in a newborn, whose mother had received high-dose methylprednisolone in late pregnancy.",2008,0
809,18795,Asthma and urticaria during disodium cromoglycate treatment. A case report.,"A 10-year-old asthmatic boy began to suffer from urticarial rash and moderately severe bronchospasm after 8 weeks' treatment with disodium cromoglycate. Initially, DSCG had helped to control his asthmatic attacks, and steroid therapy could be discontinued. Inhalation provocation test with DSCG aerosol, 4 months after stopping DSCG treatment, showed an immediate-type 1 response and urticaria. A repeat provocation test, under antihistaminic cover , failed to produce similar response. When DSCG was withdrawn, urticaria vanished and the child remained symptom-free. Disodium cromoglycate is regarded as the possible aetiological agent.",1977,6
810,1879988,Syncope induced by propranolol in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"A patient with chest pain was found to have obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. After the first oral dose of propranolol, syncope developed together with atrioventricular block. An electrophysiologic study revealed an intermittent advanced (His-Purkinje) block within the atrioventricular conduction system. Caution is recommended when treatment is initiated in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in whom there is any suspicion of abnormalities in the atrioventricular conduction tissues.",1991,6
811,18801826,Olanzapine-induced hyperglycaemic coma and neuroleptic malignant syndrome: case report and review of literature.,"Although the relationship between antipsychotic medication, particularly second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), and metabolic disturbance is increasingly accepted, there is an important, but little recognised, potential interaction between this and the other important serious adverse effect of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). We report a case of a 35-year old female who developed new onset type II diabetes mellitus with hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic coma and acute renal failure following treatment with a SGA for a first manic episode. The history is strongly suggestive of concurrent NMS. This case raises important questions about non-ketotic, hyperosmolar diabetic coma with antipsychotics, the possible association between hyperglycaemia and hyperthermia, and the direction of causality in this, the recognition of either syndrome when they co-exist and management issues in such patients. These questions are considered in the context of currently available literature.",2010,1
812,18805724,Leflunomide-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.,"Leflunomide is an immunomodulating agent with proven efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis. Although its overall safety profile is good, a few cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported.
This 36-year-old woman had rheumatoid arthritis that proved refractory to sulfasalazine and methotrexate, which were used successively in combination with symptomatic drugs. Leflunomide was started. A maculopapular rash and a fever developed 2 weeks later. The skin lesions spread rapidly to most of the body, and ulcers of the ocular and oral mucosa appeared. Leflunomide was stopped. Cholestyramine washout and prednisolone (60 mg/day) were given. The skin lesions healed over the next month. Punctate keratitis with keratinization of the cornea led to complete loss of vision.
The main adverse effects of leflunomide consist of diarrhea, nausea, liver enzyme elevation, hypertension, alopecia, and allergic skin reactions. A few cases of severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported. They require immediate discontinuation of the drug and a washout procedure to hasten drug elimination from the body.
Close monitoring for severe skin reactions is in order when using leflunomide.",2008,10
813,18810448,Thymic enlargement in a patient with juvenile idiopathic arthritis during etanercept therapy.,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors are effective in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Despite their effectiveness, anti-TNF drugs have some drawbacks such as severe adverse effects including infections and possibly lymphoproliferative disorders. In this report we described a case of juvenile idiopathic arthritis patient who developed thymic enlargement (true thymic hyperplasia), mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pleurisy associated with systemic symptoms under Etanercept treatment. The clinical presentation was highly suggestive of malignancy and the patient underwent diagnostic mediastinoscopy with biopsy.",2009,3
814,18821094,Oxcarbazepine-induced Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS).,"This is an image and brief case report of a 13-year-old boy who presented with severe rash and systemic symptoms after starting oxcarbazepine. The patient was diagnosed and treated for Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), a syndrome of fever, rash, and internal organ involvement secondary to medication administration. The image illustrates the rash seen with this drug reaction. The report is followed by a brief review of anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome and DRESS.",2008,12
815,18836269,"Diagnosis, treatment, observation and outcome of fetal supraventricular tachycardia in a twin pregnancy.","Magnetocardiography and M-mode fetal echocardiography are non-invasive techniques capable of identifying fetal arrhythmias. The STAN-fetal scalp electrode system can record the fetal echocardiogram in labor.
A patient was admitted to hospital with preterm contractions and cervical insufficiency at 28 weeks of gestation. After treatment with a beta-sympathomimetic drug (Partusisten) one fetus developed supraventricular tachycardia. After terminating the Partusisten medication, there was no effect on the fetal arrhythmia and flecainide therapy was initiated. Maintenance dosages controlled the condition thereafter. Cardiac time intervals of a fetus in labor can be presented, which did not change significantly throughout the first stage of labor.
Flecainide is an effective therapy for supraventricular tachycardias in a twin pregnancy. Analyzing the cardiac time intervals during pregnancy can improve perinatal outcome.",2008,0
816,18837734,Rosaceiform eruption induced by erlotinib.,"Adverse events with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy mainly involve the skin. The most common cutaneous adverse event is an acneiform eruption, which occurs in more than 50% of cases. The aim of this paper is to report the case of rosaceiform eruption induced by erlotinib in an 81-year-old-man and to discuss the pathogenetic role of Demodex folliculorum mites, found in the present patient, using skin scraping.",2008,10
817,18855892,Management and successful desensitization in methotrexate-induced anaphylaxis.,"Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions to methotrexate are rare. In patients with methotrexate-induced anaphylaxis, discontinuation of treatment may increase the risk of death due to cancer progression. In such patients, desensitization may enable the patient to continue treatment with methotrexate. We report the case of a child with metastatic osteosarcoma, who experienced an anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction to methotrexate. Skin tests with methotrexate were not performed because their diagnostic value is controversial. Desensitization with methotrexate was successful and allowed the patient to complete 12 additional courses of chemotherapy. Thus, we confirm that desensitization may be a safe procedure in patients with cancer who experience methotrexate-induced anaphylaxis.",2009,2
818,1888256,Drug-induced fever due to diltiazem.,"To our knowledge, drug-induced fever has not been reported with the use of diltiazem hydrochloride, a commonly prescribed calcium channel blocker. We describe a patient in whom this was the primary manifestation of drug hypersensitivity. A 67-year-old man was admitted for management of a diabetic foot ulcer. His hospital course was complicated by a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, for which diltiazem was prescribed. On the seventh day of therapy, he experienced fever, with temperatures as high as 38.8 degrees C. Despite an extensive evaluation, which included a gallium scan, a technetium bone scan, and abdominal ultrasound, a source could not be found. On the 16th day of therapy, however, relative eosinophilia developed, and 2 days later a pruritic maculopapular rash appeared. Diltiazem therapy was discontinued, leading to resolution of fever within 48 hours. Drug-induced fever should be considered in patients who have unexplained high temperatures during diltiazem therapy.",1991,9

821,18950384,Unusual weight fluctuation under corticosteroid and psychotropic treatment.,"It is generally accepted that corticosteroid therapy may increase weight. Because corticosteroids may induce several psychiatric symptoms, psychotropic drugs are required to treat these symptoms in some cases. The present study describes a patient who had unusual weight fluctuation under corticosteroid and psychotropic treatment such as mianserin and aripiprazole.",2008,10
822,18957000,Heparin-dependent antibodies and thrombosis without heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.,"Although heparin-dependent antibodies (HDAs) typically manifest with thrombocytopenia as in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), they may also manifest with preserved platelet counts. We describe a 35-year-old woman who developed severe thrombotic complications due to heparinization and unrecognized HDAs. She had received subcutaneous heparin as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis during a 5-day hospitalization for postpartum cardiomyopathy. Five days after discharge (day 1), she developed bilateral lower extremity arterial thrombi and underwent heparinization and successful lower extremity thrombectomies. A pulmonary embolus and hepatic and renal infarcts were then found. On days 2-6, the patient experienced a myocardial infarction, ischemic cerebrovascular accident, recurrent lower extremity arterial thrombus, and splenic infarct. On day 7, blood obtained on day 4 was found to be strongly positive for HDAs. In the interim, the patient had been transitioned to warfarin. Her platelet counts were never less than 75% of baseline and were consistently above 200 x 10(3)/mm(3). Hypercoagulability studies were negative. The patient's score on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated that the relationship between this adverse reaction and heparin was probable. An extensive MEDLINE search located 22 other reports of patients who developed HDAs, sometimes associated with thrombosis, but whose platelet counts did not decrease. As with our patient, many of these case reports described clinicians who overlooked thrombosis due to HDAs because the patients did not have HIT. Clinicians should be cognizant of this possibility and consider a diagnosis of HDAs in patients with ongoing thrombosis who are receiving heparin therapy. It is strongly recommended that heparin be substituted with another anticoagulant in such cases until the presence of HDAs can be definitively ruled out.",2008,11
823,18977778,Pulmonary embolism associated with protein C deficiency and abuse of anabolic-androgen steroids.,"We present the case of a 19-year-old male athlete with protein C deficiency who developed proximal deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism while abusing anabolic-androgenic steroids. Anabolic-androgenic steroids have been reported to have anticoagulatory and profibrinolytic effects in patients with protein C deficiency. Despite these antithrombotic effects, the patient developed repeated venous thromboembolism during treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin. The net effect of anabolic-androgenic steroids on the haemostatic system may change from antithrombotic to prothrombotic in male abusers of anabolic steroids with protein C deficiency.",2010,4
824,18983414,Trichosporon mucoides fungemia in a liver transplant recipient: case report and review.,"Four months after receiving an orthotopic liver transplant, a 51-year-old man was admitted for progressive liver failure and severe hepatocellular necrosis thought to be due to tacrolimus. During his hospitalization he experienced bloodstream infections including fungemia due to Trichosporon mucoides and prolonged undulating fever despite antifungal and antibacterial treatment. He underwent removal of the allograft and implantation of another liver. Fever continued postoperatively until therapy with posaconazole was initiated. Initiation of posaconazole led to clinical improvement until the patient's demise from bacteremic vancomycin-resistant enterococcal peritonitis. Trichosporonosis appears to be an emerging fungal infection among immunocompromised individuals (including both hematological and solid organ transplant recipients). T. mucoides is a rare cause of systemic infection. When it occurs, trichosporonosis usually is associated with hematological malignancies and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously reported in a liver transplant recipient. The optimal treatment is not well defined. We report here the first case using posaconazole for treatment of trichosporonosis in a liver transplant recipient caused by T. mucoides.",2009,4
825,18991509,Iatrogenic Cushing syndrome after epidural triamcinolone injections in an HIV type 1-infected patient receiving therapy with ritonavir-lopinavir.,"We report the first case of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individual receiving combination antiretroviral therapy, which included ritonavir, who developed Cushing syndrome with profound complications after epidural triamcinolone injections. This case highlights the potential of ritonavir interactions even with local injections of a corticosteroid.",2008,12
826,19003750,Acute ischaemia of the leg following accidental intra-arterial injection of dissolved flunitrazepam tablets.,"Accidental intra-arterial injection of drugs is a sporadic complication in i.v. drug addicts. A 22-year-old drug-abuser injected flunitrazepam tablets dissolved in tap water into her left femoral artery and presented with clinical signs of acute ischaemia of the left leg. Severe rhabdomyolysis developed within 5 hours after the injection. Selective arterial catheter angiography showed an acute occlusion of the posterior tibial artery. Combination therapy with i.a. urokinase, i.a. prostaglandines and i.v. anticoagulation resulted in re-opening of the obstructed distal artery and complete cessation of symptoms.",2008,11
827,19017039,Syringotropic hypersensitivity reaction associated with infliximab and leflunomide combination therapy in a child with psoriatic arthritis.,"A 17-year-old boy with refractory psoriatic arthritis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency who developed a syringotropic hypersensitivity reaction after 9 months of therapy with infliximab and leflunomide is described. Clinically, our patient showed a vasculitic-like skin rash involving both palms and soles, and histopathological examination revealed a syringotropic lymphocytic infiltrate directed toward the intra-epidermal portion of the eccrine ducts. These features have not been previously associated with infliximab or leflunomide therapy and represent a unique cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction that does not fit any known description of an immune-mediated hypersensitivity reaction.",2009,9
828,19018868,A case of severe aplastic anemia secondary to treatment with lenalidomide for multiple myeloma.,"Lenalidomide is an important contemporary treatment option for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Rare instances of autoimmune conditions have been observed in association with its use. Although moderate myelosuppression is not uncommonly seen in patients treated with lenalidomide, aplastic anemia has not previously been reported to be associated with this agent. We describe a case of severe aplastic anemia (AA) that was probably induced by lenalidomide. A 64-year-old male patient developed progressive pancytopenia three weeks into therapy with lenalidomide for his relapsed MM. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of AA and suggested the existence of an immunological reaction at the level of marrow. A gradual spontaneous recovery of normal hematopoiesis followed after the lenalidomide discontinuation.",2009,3
829,19034138,Corneal endothelial dysfunction associated with amantadine toxicity.,"To describe bilateral corneal endothelial dysfunction in a patient with Parkinson disease who was treated with long-term amantadine.
We employed an A-B-A-B single-subject research design that included clinical history, clinical findings, photographic images, and specular microscopic findings of ocular changes.
A 52-year-old woman with Parkinson disease who had taken amantadine for 6 years had bilateral corneal edema for 2 months at baseline. After cessation of amantadine, the edema resolved, and the endothelial cell densities were <or=600/mm. Corneal edema recurred when the administration of amantadine was resumed. Therefore, amantadine was permanently discontinued and the cornea cleared again.
Amantadine can cause reversible corneal edema but can irreversibly reduce the density of endothelial cells.",2008,12
830,19039026,Biopsy-proven acute interstitial nephritis associated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib: a class effect?,"Since their introduction in 2006, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) Sunitinib and Sorafenib have become the standard of care for many patients with renal cancer. They are generally well tolerated and have not been significantly implicated in renal toxicity. We report the first biopsy confirmed occurrence of acute interstitial nephritis in a patient receiving treatment with Sunitinib for metastatic renal cell cancer. However, two previous descriptions of interstitial nephritis related to treatment with TKIs, combined with this current report suggest that TKI therapy could be associated with this rare but life-threatening complication.",2009,2
831,19047493,Extrapyramidal syndrome presenting as dysphagia: a case report.,"Extrapyramidal symptoms are well-documented complications of therapy with haloperidol, even when small doses are used. Dysphagia, though uncommon, can be quite debilitating and can mimic a paraneoplastic syndrome. It is important to always review the medications the patient is taking and consider them as etiological culprits in any new symptom complex. This report highlights a case of drug-induced dysphagia in a patient receiving haloperidol for obsessive nocturnal thoughts and auditory disturbances.",0,0

After removing the methotrexate, administering intramuscular iron and undertaking a gluten-free diet, the histological and analytical alterations progressively resolved.",2008,12
833,19097599,Imatinib-induced tumor lysis syndrome: report of a case and review of the literature.,"Imatinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor which acts on breakpoint cluster region-Abelson fusion gene (BCR-ABL) positive leukemia including all phases of chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It may induce rapid apoptosis and subsequent tumor lysis syndrome. Only 3 cases of imatinib-induced tumor lysis syndrome have been reported. We herein described an additional patient with BCR-ABL (ela2) positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed tumor lysis syndrome after 10-day treatment with imatinib. Experience in the current case suggests that preventive measures for tumor lysis syndrome, including allopurinol and hydration, should be taken for patients with high leukemia burden who receive imatinib therapy, and parameters of tumor lysis should be monitored in the early phase of therapy.",0,0

Case report.,"In contrast to chronic or subacute thyroiditis, Graves' disease rarely complicates IFN-alpha therapy for chronic viral C hepatitis. We report the case of a 51-year-old man in whom IFN-alpha treatment was followed by recurrence of Graves' disease 10 years after thyroidectomy was performed and the patient was declared cured. Despite severe thyrotoxicosis, combined IFN-alpha and ribavirin therapy was continued and radioiodine treatment was considered for Graves' disease.",2008,12

The authors describe a case of interstitial granulomatous dermatitis associated with darifenacin.,2008,9
836,19116715,Rituximab-based therapy for gemcitabine-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome in a patient with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a case report.,"The purpose of this report is to describe the management and outcome of an unusual complication of a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent. Gemcitabine is a known risk factor for hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can often have a rapidly fatal clinical course despite intervention with steroids, plasmapheresis and hemodialysis.
A retrospective report of the first case of gemcitabine-related HUS, in a patient with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, treated with a variety of standard therapies in addition to rituximab is presented. The hematologic response parameters and clinical outcomes to each of the therapies given are described.
Chemotherapy-induced HUS was aggressively treated with plasmapheresis, high-dose steroids, vincristine and rituximab. Platelet recovery and clinical improvement coincided with administration of rituximab. In addition, aggressive supportive measures to manage renal failure (hemodialysis) and labile hypertension, allowed this patient to have an extended survival as a result of successful therapy for this complication despite an underlying rapidly fatal malignancy.
This case highlights the importance of timely application of aggressive measures even in patients with known diagnosis of a fatal malignancy as these interventions can prolong life and be of palliative benefit.",2009,6
837,19122478,Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms after chlorambucil treatment in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.,"Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe cutaneous drug reaction with a long duration of eruption and serious organ involvement. The mortality rate has been estimated at about 10%. Aromatic anticonvulsants, sulphamides, minocycline and more rarely carbamazepine are the principal responsible drugs. We report the first case of chlorambucil-induced DRESS syndrome in a 70-year-old man recently diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. He developed recurrent skin rash, fever, hypereosinophilia, and acute renal failure after rechallenge with chlorambucil. The condition improved slowly after stopping medication and systemic steroids. Prompt recognition of a chlorambucil drug reaction is essential in patients receiving chemotherapy.",2009,0
838,19131789,Early recognition of renal toxicity of high-dose methotrexate therapy: a case report.,"A 10-year-old boy with osteosarcoma and normal renal function manifested laboratory evidence of impending renal toxicity and extreme elevation of aspartate aminotrasferase and alanine aminotransferase within 2 hours after the completion of a 4-hour infusion of high-dose methotrexate (MTX) (12 g/m2), and went on to develop acute renal failure with life-threatening hyperkalemia 29 hours later. Although his renal function recovered completely with high-dose leucovorin, hemodialysis, charcoal hemoperfusion, and carboxypeptidase G2, we present this case to emphasize that signs of renal toxicity may be present as early as 2 hours after the completion of a 4-hour MTX infusion, and to suggest that monitoring for MTX toxicity should perhaps begin within a few hours after the completion of 4-hour MTX infusion.",2008,12
839,19145124,Multifocal electroretinographic abnormalities in ethambutol-induced visual loss.,Two patients who developed decreased visual acuity after several months of ethambutol treatment for Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection had bitemporal visual field defects that suggested optic chiasm damage. Multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) disclosed markedly low-amplitude responses at fixation and in the regions corresponding to the visual field defects. These results suggested that the visual dysfunction might be entirely attributable to retinal rather than optic nerve toxicity. These are the first reported patients to show mfERG abnormalities that correspond to bitemporal visual field defects and add to the growing evidence that ethambutol damages the retina.,2008,12
840,19183077,Tenofovir-associated nephrotoxicity in two HIV-infected adolescent males.,"We report two cases of tenofovir (TDF)-associated nephrotoxicity in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents. The first case, a 16-year-old African American male with an absolute CD4+ cell count of 314 cells/mm(3), presented with an abrupt rise in serum creatinine leading to irreversible renal failure while on TDF-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). While the patient had evidence of underlying kidney disease, the timing of his renal failure indicates that TDF played a central role. The second case, a 16-year-old African-American male with an absolute CD4+ cell count of 895 cells/mm3, presented with rickets and hypophosphatemia while receiving TDF-based HAART. To our knowledge, these cases represent the first reports of TDF-associated irreversible renal failure and rickets in pediatric patients. We believe these cases highlight important and potentially irreversible side effects of this agent and emphasize the need for further studies of the renal safety of TDF in pediatric patients.",2009,1

843,19212144,Temsirolimus-induced glomerulopathy.,A 58-year-old man with advanced renal cell carcinoma developed grade 3 proteinuria (8.5 g/24 h) without microscopic hematuria or renal insufficiency five days after temsirolimus infusion. Kidney biopsy revealed ischemic glomeruli and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesion. Proteinuria level decreased to 2.80 g per day two weeks after temsirolimus withdrawal. Clinicians should be aware to this complication.,2009,0
844,19217693,Persistent hypoglycemia in a patient with diabetes taking etanercept for the treatment of psoriasis.,"We report a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus who, while treated with the antitumor necrosis factor-alpha blocking agent etanercept for severe plaque psoriasis, experienced persistent hypoglycemia requiring the lowering and eventual elimination of his previous insulin regimen. After 20 months of therapy on etanercept, his plaque psoriasis markedly improved, whereas both his fasting blood sugars and glycosylated hemoglobin A(1c) decreased. Hypoglycemia can be a serious side effect of etanercept in patients already on antidiabetic medications known to cause hypoglycemia, such as sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and insulin. Thus, it is important for dermatologists treating patients with diabetes and antitumor necrosis factor-alpha agents for psoriasis to be aware of potential hypoglycemia and to adjust antidiabetes therapy accordingly.",2009,6
845,19224802,An exaggerated hypertensive response to glycopyrrolate therapy for bradycardia associated with high-dose dexmedetomidine.,"At our institution, high-dose i.v. dexmedetomidine is used to provide sedation for pediatric patients undergoing nonpainful radiological imaging studies. Some of these patients exhibit marked bradycardia (more than 20% deviation from the lowest age-adjusted normal values) while maintaining an arterial blood pressure within an acceptable normal range. We report on three cases wherein treatment of dexmedetomidine-induced bradycardia with i.v. glycopyrrolate (5.0 microg/kg) not only resulting in resolution of bradycardia but also resulting in an exaggerated increase of arterial blood pressure.",2009,3
846,19235747,Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the skull base.,"Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is reported in up to 18.6% of patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates and can result in significant morbidity. Most cases are managed by oral surgeons with only a handful of reports appearing in the otolaryngology literature. We present a unique case of extensive BRONJ involving the maxilla, sinuses, and skull base, complicated by sinusitis and an intracranial abscess. This is the first description of BRONJ involving the skull base. The pathogenesis and management of this process are reviewed.",2009,3
847,19260037,Is it quinine TTP/HUS or quinine TMA? ADAMTS13 levels and implications for therapy.,"Thrombocytopenia with or without microangiopathy following quinine is often referred to as quinine ""hypersensitivity."" When schistocytes are present it is frequently termed ""quinine-associated TTP/HUS."" A severe deficiency of the vWF-cleaving protease, ADAMTS13, is associated with idiopathic TTP. A previous study of patients with ""quinine-associated TTP/HUS"" found that ADAMTS13 activities were not abnormal in 12/12 patients. A retrospective review of TTP patients with quinine-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) for whom ADAMTS13 was measured before plasma exchange was performed. Six patients were identified. All were females (age range: 43 to 73, mean = 61.7 years) and had taken quinine for leg cramps. Four of the six experienced renal failure requiring dialysis. Five of the patients had D-Dimers levels measured, all were elevated. In four patients the levels were > or = 18 times the upper limit of normal. ADAMTS13 was normal in four patients and mildly decreased in two patients. We conclude that while thrombocytopenia and schistocytosis can be seen in quinine-associated TTP/HUS, the pathophysiology seems to be distinct from that seen in most cases of idiopathic TTP (i.e., severely decreased ADAMTS13 with an inhibitor). We recommend that a TMA in association with quinine be consistently referred to as quinine-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (quinine-TMA) to better distinguish this entity from idiopathic TTP. The use of plasma exchange in quinine-TMA is called into question.",2009,0
848,19266307,Complications associated with primary and secondary perforation of the bladder following immediate instillations of epirubicin after transurethral resection of superficial urothelial tumours.,"Significant decreases in tumour recurrence rates of up to 50% are reported after one immediate postoperative instillation of chemotherapeutic drugs, such as epirubicin or mitomycin C. However, the extremely rare occurrence of complications related to perforation of the bladder can be detrimental. Perforation of the bladder seems to be iatrogenic (primary) or drug-induced (secondary).
We present two cases of significant morbidity related to primary and secondary perforation of the bladder following two instillations of epirubicin.
The patient with the primary perforation was managed conservatively, while the second was subjected to immediate surgical exploration. The two patients were finally released in good condition.
Complications concerning a primary perforation of the bladder and instillation of chemotherapeutic drugs can be easily avoided by recognising the perforation intraoperatively. However, we postulate that a delayed perforation of the bladder might occur due to the cytotoxic effect to the bladder tissue of the instilled drugs.",2009,12
849,19281746,Aliskiren-associated acute renal failure with hyperkalemia.,"We report the first case of acute renal failure with hyperkalemia associated with the recently marketed direct renin inhibitor aliskiren. To optimize blood pressure control, the antihypertensive medication of a 76-year-old hypertensive female patient was changed from the angiotensin II receptor antagonist irbesartan to aliskiren. Spironolactone was continued, as serum creatinine and potassium levels were initially normal. Two weeks later the patient presented with acute oliguric renal failure, symptomatic hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, necessitating emergency dialytic treatment. Unrecognized pre-existing renal insufficiency (CKD Stage 2 - 3) and the continuation of spironolactone were identified as predisposing risk factors.",2009,3
850,19296063,A case of acute cardiomyopathy and pericarditis associated with methylphenidate.,"Methylphenidate is a potent central nervous system stimulant that exerts its effects by increasing synaptic levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. It has become key to treating attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. As the use of stimulant medications has ballooned in the past decade, so too has awareness of the cardiovascular complications of these drugs. Effects on heart rate and blood pressure as well as tachyarrhythmias have been well described. However, acute cardiomyopathy and pericarditis secondary to methylphenidate use has been rarely reported. We report the case of a 17-year-old male who developed chest pain, elevated cardiac biomarkers, and acute left ventricular dysfunction following a single dose of methylphenidate. The risk of cardiomyopathy in the setting of methylphenidate treatment should prompt further study on the safety of this drug, and lead to ways of identifying those at risk of developing these complications.",2009,3
851,19299370,Probable enoxaparin-induced hepatotoxicity.,"A case of probable enoxaparin-induced hepatotoxicity is described.
A 29-year-old woman sought treatment from a pulmonologist for a dry, hacking, constant cough not relieved by fast-acting inhalers or narcotic cough medications that had lasted for three weeks. Her primary care physician had earlier made a preliminary diagnosis of pertussis and prescribed a short course of azithromycin and corticosteroids, which did not help relieve the symptoms. Computed tomography angiography of her chest revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli with a moderate clot burden, which resulted in her hospitalization. The pulmonary emboli were thought to be associated with her oral contraceptive, which was discontinued at hospital admission. Anticoagulant therapy was initiated with subcutaneous enoxaparin and oral warfarin. Beginning the second day of therapy, the patient complained of nausea and associated vomiting. Diagnostic procedures did not reveal any liver, kidney, splenic, or pancreatic abnormalities. The results of laboratory tests revealed elevated levels of hepatic enzymes, including alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). Tests for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Enoxaparin therapy was discontinued, and the patient was maintained on oral warfarin. Clinical and laboratory signs of liver injury resolved over the next few days, with a return to baseline levels of AST and ALT levels over the subsequent months. According to the Naranjo et al. adverse-reaction probability scale, enoxaparin was the probable cause of hepatotoxicity in this patient.
A woman receiving enoxaparin every 12 hours developed signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity after the second dose. The case was unusual in the rapidity and magnitude of hepatic enzyme elevation.",2009,4
852,19307676,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome associated with methotrexate neurotoxicity: conventional magnetic resonance and diffusion-weighted imaging findings.,"The addition of intrathecal methotrexate to treatment protocols has increased survival rates in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia but is also associated with varying degrees of neurotoxicity. We describe a 15-year-old female patient diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting with status epilepticus after receiving intrathecal methotrexate. Magnetic resonance imaging showed reversible cortical and subcortical changes consisting of high-intensity lesions on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences with postgadolinium enhancement, low signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging and increased apparent diffusion coefficient. These findings were consistent with the posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. We report our conventional magnetic resonance and diffusion-weighted imaging findings and briefly discuss the pathophysiology of the syndrome.",2009,8
853,19318596,Cyclosporine-induced pain syndrome in a child undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant.,"To report a case of calcineurin-induced pain syndrome (CIPS) in a child undergoing his second hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).
A 6.1-year-old child received cyclosporine and methotrexate for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) prophylaxis after his first HSCT for acute myeloblastic leukemia. Amlodipine was given for the treatment of hypertension. Symptoms of CIPS were not observed. After the second HSCT at the age of 6.7 years, the child received cyclosporine (target trough whole blood cyclosporine concentration range 150-200 microg/L), starting on day -3, and mycophenolate mofetil for aGVHD prophylaxis. With the first cyclosporine dose, the patient complained of leg pain that was most severe during the cyclosporine infusion. Analgesic agents and a change from intravenous to oral administration of cyclosporine were ineffective in controlling the pain. Magnetic resonance imaging findings on day 10 showed periosteal soft tissue changes and mild bone marrow edema of the femora and tibiae. Tacrolimus was substituted for cyclosporine on day 20; on day 21 amlodipine was initiated to manage hypertension. Trough whole blood tacrolimus concentrations ranged from 1.7 to 6.2 microg/L. Pain was reduced in severity by day 29 and completely resolved once tacrolimus was discontinued on day 42. In this case, CIPS was considered to be probably associated with cyclosporine according to the Naranjo probability scale.
CIPS is hypothesized to result from calcineurin-induced vascular changes that disturb bone perfusion and permeability, leading to intraosseous vasoconstriction and bone marrow edema. In our patient, symptoms were most acute during the infusion, when whole blood cyclosporine concentrations were likely to be the highest. Our patient's symptoms were resolved when tacrolimus was substituted for cyclosporine and amlodipine was initiated.
Interventions aimed at reducing pain associated with CIPS may include the initiation of calcium-channel blocker therapy and conversion to an alternative calcineurin inhibitor.",2009,4
854,19331262,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to risperidone treatment in a child with Joubert syndrome.,"Joubert syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by hypotonia, ataxia, episodic hyperpnea, psychomotor retardation, abnormal ocular movements, cerebellar vermian hypoplasia, and molar tooth sign on magnetic resonance imaging. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an uncommon and potentially fatal idiosynchratic reaction of antipsychotic drugs, in which the clinical scenario encompass muscular rigidity, hyperthermia, autonomic dysfunction, altered consciousness, high creatinine phosphokinase levels, and leukocytosis. This report describes a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to risperidone in a child with Joubert syndrome.",2009,3
855,19336028,A case of tuberculosis in a patient on Efalizumab and Etanercept for treatment of refractory palmopustular psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.,"We discuss a patient with a history of a positive tuberculin skin test, who presented with severe, recalcitrant palmoplantar pustular psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis whose symptoms did not resolve with monotherapy of etanercept (Enbrel) or efalizumab (Raptiva) alone, but did respond to a combination of both biologics. However, our patient was later found to have re-activation tuberculosis after long-term treatment. This case highlights many key points for treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with biologics. Namely, that recalcitrant psoriatic skin lesions may have good clearing on one biologic, such as efalizumab, and arthritic symptoms can be well-controlled with etanercept, leading patients to be on two different biologics concurrently to control symptoms. However, it also highlights the importance of determining a patient's tuberculosis status, initiating prophylactic anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to starting treatment with etanercept, and setting up an adequate treatment regime if the patient develops active tuberculosis during therapy with etanercept.",2009,2
856,19354059,Rapid warfarin reversal with factor VIIa in an elderly trauma patient with retroperitoneal hematoma.,"While mortality from trauma increases, there has been a decline in mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases which parallels advances in antithrombotic and anticoagulation therapy. Warfarin (coumadin) is the most common oral anticoagulant used for chronic anticoagulant therapy and most patients requiring such therapy are elderly (greater than 65 years old). The most common complication of warfarin use is adverse bleeding. It is becoming increasingly evident the population at highest risk for sustaining a complication related to anticoagulation is that group presenting with traumatic brain injury. Recent studies show that patients with other injury patterns do not appear to have significant differences post trauma, although the data about such outcomes is sparse. Significant bleeding from retroperitoneal hematomas is more often associated with major pelvic fractures from high energy blunt force mechanisms, and the blood loss may be tamponaded by the retroperitoneal structures if natural clotting mechanisms are intact. Recombinant Factor VIIa (FVIIa) can be used to reverse coagulopathy in patients on coumadin who sustain a traumatic injury.",2009,3
857,19357764,Is it safe to switch from stavudine to zidovudine after developing symptomatic hyperlactatemia?,"In resource limited settings patients on antiretroviral treatment who develop stavudine induced hyperlactatemia are often switched to zidovudine on the basis of published studies that demonstrate that this agent can be a safe alternative.
We describe here a case of a 60 year old female that experienced a relapse of symptomatic hyperlactatemia after being switched from stavudine to zidovudine and how the case was managed at the Infectious Diseases Institute, Kampala, Uganda.
This case shows that switching to zidovudine potentially can lead to a hyperlactatemia relapse. Therefore we recommend close follow up for patients that are switched from stavudine to zidovudine and, in case lactate measurement is not possible, free programs should provide safer drugs such as abacavir and tenofovir for patients that develop hyperlactatemia.",2008,6
858,19363904,Anaphylactic reaction to bacitracin ointment.,"We report a case of an 11-year-old boy who experienced an anaphylactic reaction after administration of bacitracin ointment. After falling and scraping his left elbow, bacitracin ointment was applied to the wound. Within minutes, he experienced an adverse reaction consisting of bilateral pruritus of the feet, which quickly progressed to his head; diaphoresis; nausea; vomiting; facial pallor; and hives. An epinephrine injection was administered and the boy immediately felt better. He was taken to the emergency department and given intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate and intravenous diphenhydramine hydrochloride. He was kept for observation, recovered well, and was discharged with prescriptions for prednisone and diphenhydramine hydrochloride. We discuss other similar cases so physicians continue to be aware of this rare yet potentially life-threatening reaction to a commonly used medication.",2009,3
859,19365885,Hypoglycemia induced by long-acting somatostatin analogues in a patient with nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumor.,"Somatostatin and its long-acting analogues are effective in symptom control in patients with functional neuroendocrine tumors; they are also able to control tumor growth. Somatostatin analogues are safe and generally well tolerated. In some cases they may cause serious complications. Somatostatin analogues are potent inhibitors of growth hormone (GH) and glucagon secretion. They cause impairment of hepatic glucose output and delay in intestinal absorption of carbohydrates. Patients with huge tumor mass and multiple liver metastases have increased risk of tumor-induced hypoglycemia. In these patients, long-acting octreotide may trigger serious hypoglycemia. The patients whose glucose control is dependent on counter-regulatory hormones should be monitored for the possibility of hypoglycemia. Herein, we present a patient with severe and prolonged hypoglycemia after long-acting octreotide treatment.",0,0
860,19390192,Leukopenia due to parvovirus B19 in a Crohn's disease patient using azathioprine.,"Thiopurines such as azathioprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine are frequently used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. Patients with low or absent thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity, resulting in high 6-thioguanine nucleotide levels, have an increased risk of developing leukopenia. Alternatively, certain viral infections could induce leukopenia. We present the case of an adult Crohn's disease patient with a parvovirus B19 infection and leukopenia during long-term AZA therapy. The uncomplicated long-term use of adequately-dosed AZA and stable non-toxic metabolite levels could not acknowledge TPMT deficiency as a primary cause of the leukopenia. parvovirus B19 was assumed to induce the leukopenia by restraining myeloid proliferation. In addition, AZA probably potentiated susceptibility to this viral infection and may have inhibited adequate immunological defense. Leukopenia during thiopurine therapy not explained by TPMT deficiency could be induced by parvovirus B19 infection and compels temporal but not permanent cessation of thiopurine therapy.",2009,0
861,19402273,Isoniazid induced gynaecomastia: a case report.,"Gynaecomastia due to anti-tubercular chemotherapy is a rare side effect. Isoniazid causing breast tissue enlargement has been very rarely reported. We report a 60-year old, male patient of Pulmonary Tuberculosis who was started on antituberculous treatment (ATT) with rifampicin (R), isoniazid (H), ethambutol (E) and pyrazinamide (Z) together for initial two months and R, H & E thereon. After five months of initiation of treatment, while receiving RHE, he developed painful bilateral gynaecomastia. Isoniazid was stopped and patient was continued on R & E till completion of the treatment up to nine months. After stopping isoniazid, his breast swelling subsided to some extent and became non-tender. Follow up, at six months, after stopping the course of treatment, patient was asymptomatic except for slight bilateral non-tender breast enlargement.",2009,1
862,19423476,Cryptococcus neoformans fatal sepsis in a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient treated with alemtuzumab: case report and review of the literature.,"Cryptococcosis is a disseminated fungal disease typically associated with immunosuppression and characterized by high mortality rates. Cryptococcus neoformans has been reported to be isolated from blood cultures in around 20% of patients with cryptococcosis, and cryptococcemia has been correlated with poor prognosis. We report a case of fatal C. neoformans fungemia in a neutropenic patient with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with alemtuzumab. The patient presented with loss of consciousness and died after 5 days of antifungal therapy with liposomal amphotericin B. The international literature regarding opportunistic infections after immunosuppressive therapy with alemtuzumab with particular attention on fungal infections has also been reviewed.",2009,4
863,19434733,Secondary acute myeloid leukemia after etoposide therapy for haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.,"Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon disease with a high fatality rate. Etoposide is an important component of current HLH treatment regimes. Two patients with HLH developed etoposide-related secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) following therapy for HLH. Etoposide, an epipodophyllotoxin, is a topoisomerase II inhibitor that interacts with DNA to potentiate leukaemogenesis. The risk of developing sAML is estimated to be between 1% and 5%, 2-20 years after exposure to etoposide but may also be related to cumulative drug doses, treatment schedules, host factors and co-administration of other antineoplastic agents.",2009,9
864,19448237,Polymyoclonus seizure resulting from accidental injection of tranexamic acid in spinal anesthesia.,"We present a case of accidental injection of tranexamic acid instead of bupivacaine during spinal anesthesia. One minute after intrathecal injection of 3.5 mL of solution, the patient developed myoclonus of his lower extremities. Accidental intrathecal injection of the wrong drug was suspected and a used ampule of tranexamic acid discovered in the trash can. The ampules of tranexamic acid (500 mg/5 mL) and bupivacaine (5 mg/mL, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were similar in appearance. General anesthesia was induced. Ten hours later, the patient developed myoclonus of his upper extremities and face. His polymyoclonus was successfully treated with phenytoin, sodium thiopental infusion, sodium valproate and supportive care of the hemodynamic, and respiratory systems. The patient's condition progressively improved to full recovery.",2009,6
865,19474653,Rhabdomyolysis following clarithromycin monotherapy.,Macrolide antibiotics inhibit the metabolism of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) that may result in myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. We report the first case of rhabdomyolysis related to the administration of clarithromycin without concurrent use of other medications. Inhibition of cytochrome P450 could be one of the potential causative mechanisms of myopathy in our case. Clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse effect of a widely used drug.,2009,7
866,19499966,Onset of male gynaecomastia in a patient treated with sunitinib for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.,"Sunitinib is an orally administered multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated substantial antitumour activity in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The more common grade 3 or 4 adverse effects of sunitinib include hypertension, fatigue, hand-foot syndrome, elevated lipase and lymphopenia. We report the case of a 69-year-old patient with metastatic renal clear-cell carcinoma, treated with nephrectomy and three lines of therapy (interleukin-2 plus interferon-alpha2a, vinorelbine plus gemcitabine, and capecitabine), who started a fourth-line therapy with oral sunitinib because of disease progression. At the end of his fifth cycle of sunitinib therapy, the patient complained of the development of abnormally large mammary glands associated with pain and peri-areolar erythema. After 2 weeks' off therapy, a partial reduction in mammary gland enlargement, local pain and erythema was observed. However, re-initiation of sunitinib treatment was followed by bilateral breast enlargement again. The mechanism by which sunitinib induces gynaecomastia is thought to be associated with an unknown direct action on breast hormonal receptors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between sunitinib and gynaecomastia.",2009,0
867,19512997,Divalproex sodium-induced eosinophilic pleural effusion.,Eosinophilic pleural effusion is defined as an effusion in which eosinophils constitute more than 10% of white blood cells. These effusions can be due to multiple causes with drugs being implicated as one of the etiological agents. We report a case of 48-year-old woman with seizure disorder on divalproex sodium (Depakote) who presented with dyspnea. A chest radiograph demonstrated right pleural effusion. Investigations showed peripheral blood eosinophilia with thoracocentesis revealing eosinophilic exudative pleural effusion. An extensive workup for other causes of eosinophilic pleural effusion was unrevealing. Withdrawal of Depakote resulted in resolution of the effusion.,0,0

869,19520277,Stupor and fast activity on electroencephalography in a child treated with valproate.,The case of a 4-year-old girl with valproate-induced stupor and electroencephalographic pattern of increased fast activity is reported. Stupor and fast activity have been related to the effects on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors mediated by endozepines or by exogenous drugs such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. The action of valproate in GABA metabolism and in GABA neuronal networks could produce a similar result through a hyperrecruitment of GABA-mediated postsynaptic transmission.,2009,7

871,19540093,Tigecycline-induced acute pancreatitis: case report and literature review.,"Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent structurally related to minocycline. Pancreatitis has been associated with the tetracycline class of antibiotics and concerns about tigecycline-induced acute pancreatitis have recently been raised. We describe a 69-year-old female who received tigecycline for treatment of a complicated skin and skin-structure infection. Following 7 days of tigecycline she developed severe abdominal pain and elevated pancreatic enzymes suggesting acute pancreatitis. According to the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, tigecycline was the probable cause of her acute pancreatitis. Clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse effect of tigecycline. We recommend that clinicians monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis, including abdominal pain, during treatment with tigecycline.",2009,11
872,1954704,Drug induced polymyositis secondary to leuprolide acetate (Lupron) therapy for prostate carcinoma.,"Inflammatory myopathy has been associated with systemic inflammatory processes, endocrinopathies, malignancies and infections. Drug induced myopathies have been implicated with the use of several medications.

873,19555801,Aripiprazole-induced hiccups: a case report.,"Hiccups can arise from idiopathic, psychogenic and organic causes. The use of therapeutic drugs forms one of the important causes of hiccups. Although the exact pathophysiological processes involved have not yet been established, the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin and gamma amino butyric aid (GABA) have been documented to play a significant role in the generation of hiccups. We report a patient of organic bipolar affective disorder who developed hiccups with the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole. The possible underlying neurotransmitter mechanisms, predisposing factors and clinical implications of this rare adverse event are discussed.",0,0
874,19567656,Sertraline-induced rhabdomyolysis in an elderly patient with dementia and comorbidities.,"To describe a case of sertraline-induced rhabdomyolysis in an elderly patient with dementia and comorbidities.
A 71-year-old woman visited a psychiatrist in September 2007 for her depressed mood. Her medical history included vascular dementia accompanied by depression, arterial hypertension, and heart failure, as well as cardiac pacemaker implantation several years earlier for severe bradyarrythmia. She had begun taking amisulpride 50 mg/day and diazepam 2 mg at bedtime 6 months prior to the psychiatrist appointment, with poor relief of her depressed mood. Her drug therapy also included nicergoline 30 mg/day, amlodipine 5 mg/day, aspirin 100 mg/day, candesartan 16 mg/day, and atenolol 25 mg/day. At this psychiatrist visit, sertraline 50 mg/day was added for her depression, and was continued after a geriatrician visit in October. Her mood improved significantly. On December 18, 2007, she was admitted to the cardiology unit to undergo a pacemaker replacement. Laboratory tests revealed creatine kinase (CK) 7952 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 1021 IU/L, myoglobin 2322 U/L, and aspartate aminotransferase 362 IU/L, resulting in a diagnosis of iatrogenic rhabdomyolysis. Amisulpride and sertraline were discontinued. On December 24, serum CK was 839 IU/L and myoglobin was 91 U/L and the patient was discharged. On January 22, laboratory tests showed normal values of CK, CK-MB, and myoglobin. Sertraline 50 mg/day was again prescribed for the patient's persistent depressed mood. Fifteen days later, blood tests showed CK 1327 IU/L and myoglobin 324 U/L; therefore, the drug was discontinued. CK and myoglobin levels normalized a week later. On April 2, escitalopram was started. At time of writing, there was no evidence of any increase in CK, myoglobin, or other markers of rhabdomyolysis.
The Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between sertraline treatment and the onset of rhabdomyolysis. No relationship between amisulpride and rhabdomyolysis was found. Furthermore, rechallenge with sertraline caused CK and myoglobin to again increase, which was reversed following a discontinuation of sertraline. The patient's other comorbidities and medications have not been suggested as possible interactions with sertraline that can cause rhabdomyolysis. Genetic defects of sertraline demethylation and/or Pglycoprotein binding or concurrent circumstances may explain the onset of rhabdomyolysis in this particular patient.
This patient's rhabdomyolysis was probably induced by sertraline therapy.",2009,7
875,19570088,Tumor lysis syndrome after transcatheter arterial infusion of cisplatin and embolization therapy for liver metastases of melanoma.,"Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is rare in the treatment of solid tumors, but it may occur in myelolymphoproliferative diseases.
A 58-year-old man with bulky metastatic melanoma of the liver was treated with transcatheter arterial infusion of cisplatin and embolization therapy. The patient developed classic signs of TLS within 24 h of chemotherapy, including acute renal failure.
The patient was treated with aggressive hydration, allopurinol, and repeated hemodialysis. He gradually improved and his biochemical markers returned to normal.
TLS is an uncommon, but potentially life-threatening, complication in melanoma and other solid tumors. It is important for oncologists to recognize this complication and prevent its development if bulky metastatic disease and several pre-existing risk factors, such as multiple and bulky liver metastases, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and hyperuricemia, are present.",2009,7
876,19579947,Priapism associated with olanzapine.,"Priapism is a rare but serious adverse effect of psychotropic drugs where antipsychotic agents were implicated in 15 to 26% of priapism associated with medications. Among atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, risperidone and olanzapine have been reported to be associated with the condition. The patient was a 24-years-old male referred to the OPD Clinic at Zare Psychiatry Hospital in 2007 with symptoms of delusion of control, delusion of persecution, delusion of somatic and auditory hallucination, for the last year. He had priapism following the use of olanzapine.

On day 3 he was admitted and his electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus arrest with junctional escape rhythm with a rate of 42 min(-1). Three days after stopping the medication he reverted to normal sinus rhythm. A 55-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to hospital with triple vessel disease. He had a permanent pacemaker inserted 4 years previously for Mobitz type II AV block detected on stress electrocardiogram, which developed 1 month after initiation of lopinavir/ritonavir. These two cases highlight the importance of considering lopinavir/ritonavir induced arrhythmias when dealing with HIV-positive individuals.",2009,9

Gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease is an unusual presentation of this yeast infection. We describe a unique case of disseminated cryptococcosis presenting as colitis that mimicked an exacerbation of Crohn's disease in a TNF-alpha inhibitor recipient. Review of existing literature shows that in immunocompromised patients, GI cryptococcosis invariably coexists with disseminated cryptococcosis, often lacks prominent GI symptomatology, and is primarily diagnosed postmortem. In cases with opportunistic infections, discontinuation of TNF-alpha inhibitors is a common practice, however rapid rebound of inflammatory responses may incur the risk of immune reconstitution syndrome.",2010,5
880,19667003,Carbamazepine-induced hyperammonemia.,"A case of carbamazepine-induced hyperammonemia is presented.
A 26-year-old man with bipolar disorder, seizures, and mild mental retardation secondary to a traumatic brain injury began treatment with carbamazepine for aggression and seizure control. After three weeks of carbamazepine therapy, the patient arrived at the emergency department (ED) with severe agitation and aggressive behavior. His oral medications included topiramate, carbamazepine, olanzapine, quetiapine, guanfacine, and desmopressin acetate. The patient's medications had been stable for at least six months except for the addition of carbamazepine one month before his arrival at the ED. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were found to be within normal limits, as were his liver profile results, complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating-hormone level, and serum chemistry panel. His serum carbamazepine concentration was 3.9 microg/mL (reference range, 4-12 microg/mL), and his serum ammonia concentration was 127 microg/dL (reference range, 19-60 microg/dL). Carbamazepine was discontinued upon admission, and the patient was treated with oral lactulose. Since carbamazepine was discontinued and had been prescribed for bipolar disorder, his olanzapine dosage was increased, and trazodone was added at bedtime for insomnia. Of note, the patient had been on carbamazepine therapy one year earlier and had experienced the same adverse event. He had also developed elevated serum ammonia levels while on valproic acid. The patient's serum ammonia level returned to normal by hospital day 4, and he was discharged to his group home.
A 26-year-old man with bipolar disorder developed hyperammonemia three weeks after initiating carbamazepine therapy.",2009,8
881,1966850,Adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy aggravated by cis-platinum nephrotoxicity requiring dialysis.,Complications of chemotherapy for a synovial sarcoma in an eight-year old boy included cisplatinum nephrotoxicity and adriamycin cardiotoxicity. The resultant renal failure and fluid overload necessitated peritoneal dialysis. Intractable hypomagnesemia was also a prominent feature.,1990,0
882,19669617,Acute bilateral phrenic neuropathy following treatment with adalimumab.,"The recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human TNF-a adalimumab (Humira) has been recently introduced for the treatment of moderate/severe psoriasis. Neurological diseases have been rarely described as adverse events of anti-TNF agents. A case of acute respiratory failure due to diaphragmatic weakness following adalimumab therapy for psoriasis is described. A 65-year-old female patient presented with jaundice followed 2 days later by severe dyspnea and tachypnea which worsened when patient was lying flat, 1 week after the fourth dose of adalimumab. Isoniazid and vitamin B6 were co-administered with adalimumab. A symmetric elevation of diaphragms was shown on radiography and fluoroscopy. A pulmonary restrictive defect with a prominent decline of forced vital capacity (FVC) when the patient was on supine position was recorded. In the absence of specific limb electrophysiological abnormalities, acute bilateral symmetric phrenic neuropathy was diagnosed. The patient was a borderline candidate for mechanical ventilation for 3 weeks. Conservative treatment with oxygen was administered and both respiratory and liver disorder resolved 4 weeks following admission. A causal relationship of phrenal neuropathy with adalimumab is herein discussed.",2009,11
883,19687711,Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: consequence of treatment of an emerging pathogen.,"We report a case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) secondary to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-Sx) therapy for presumed community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection. Although the association between SJS/TEN and the sulfonamide class of antibiotics is well established, the increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA has left practitioners with limited regimens to effectively treat skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in the outpatient setting. In the case of SSTIs, alternative treatment of these infections should be considered, especially when the bacterial pathogen is unknown. Future investigations evaluating the efficacy of adjunctive antibiotics for purulent SSTIs and monitoring the incidence of SJS/TEN in the era of CA-MRSA are necessary to reduce unnecessary use of sulfonamide drugs. The potential development of SJS/TEN, a severe life-threatening illness, emphasizes the need for judicious use of TMP-Sx and close monitoring and follow-up for patients who were given TMP-Sx for SSTIs.",2009,8
884,19690222,Spontaneous hemothorax following anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin.,"To report a case of spontaneous hemothorax following anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for the management of suspected pulmonary embolism.
A 66-year-old man with a background history of breast carcinoma was admitted with pleuritic chest pain. He was initially managed as a suspected case of pulmonary embolism. Dalteparin, an LMWH, was started at a maximum dose of 18,000 units subcutaneously once daily, according to British national prescribing guidelines. On day 4, following 3 doses of dalteparin, the patient developed acute respiratory distress attributable to a massive right hemothorax confirmed by computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and intercostal drainage of 1500 mL of frank blood. CTPA identified no pulmonary embolus or vascular abnormalities. Reaccumulation of hemothorax occurred over the 48 hours following drain removal, necessitating insertion of a second drain, which removed 1400 mL of blood-stained fluid. The patient's hemoglobin decreased from 12.7 to 8.5 g/dL and he received a 3-unit blood transfusion. Histologic assessment of pleural fluid revealed no malignancy and results of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery were normal. Discontinuation of dalteparin on day 4 led to resolution of symptoms.
The causal association between anticoagulant therapy and spontaneous hemothorax remains relatively uncommon. The striking temporal relationship between commencing dalteparin on day 1 and subsequent development of effusion on day 4, following 3 doses of LMWH, led us to believe that the bleed occurred as a result of the therapy. Exclusion of other causes strengthened this conclusion. Application of the Naranjo probability scale categorized this adverse reaction as being probably due to LMWH.
Spontaneous hemothorax is a rare phenomenon in conjunction with LMWH but should be considered in cases of acute respiratory distress following commencement of LMWH.",2009,9
885,19707032,Acute vision loss after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (avastin) associated with ocular ischemic syndrome.,"To report a patient with diabetic rubeosis who suffered from acute retinal ischemic change and stroke after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab.
A 55-year-old man had diabetes with unilateral rubeosis and macular edema. Three days after receiving intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in 0.1 ml), he developed acute vision loss and change of consciousness. A complete ocular examination, fluorescein angiography, carotid artery Doppler sonography and brain magnetic resonance imaging were performed.
Best corrected visual acuity before injection was 6/60 in the left eye. He had underlying left carotid artery stenosis combined with bilateral preproliferative diabetic retinopathy. Three days after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, acute ocular ischemic syndrome occurred. He also suffered from acute stroke, and brain magnetic resonance angiography showed total left internal carotid artery occlusion. The final visual acuity was no light perception in the left eye and 3/6 in the right eye.
Patients receiving intravitreal injections of bevacizumab should be evaluated for potential systemic risk factors such as carotid insufficiency, coagulopathy and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Acute ocular ischemic change may be associated with intravitreal injection of bevacizumab in patients with vascular compromised diabetic retinopathy and/or underlying stenosis of the carotid artery.",2010,0
886,19717383,Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia following HIV-associated lymphoma.,"In the highly active antiretroviral therapy era, an increasingly large number of HIV-infected patients are developing non- AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs). As patients survive longer, long-term therapy-related complications take on greater importance. Herein, we describe a patient with AIDS who presented to medical attention with pancytopenia 48 months postchemotherapy with etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab (R-EPOCH) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy showed a moderately hypocellular marrow; 51% of the nucleated cells were blasts with myelomonocytic differentiation. Cytogenetic studies revealed an abnormal karyotype with deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q21) and 2 additional copies of the MLL gene attached to the short arms of chromosome 10 in 80% of the metaphase cells examined. With the diagnosis of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secured, he began induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine. Two weeks later, he died of fungal septicemia and multiorgan failure. Through a literature search, we were able to identify 4 additional cases of therapy-related AML in AIDS patients following chemotherapy for lymphomas. The median age of these patients at the time of AML diagnosis was 39 years (range, 33-59 years), the median time from the treatment of lymphoma to AML was 18 months (range, 11-48 months), and the median survival following induction chemotherapy was 4 weeks (range, 2-16 weeks). With many HIV-infected patients surviving alkylator and topoisomerase inhibitor-based treatment and radiation therapy for AIDS-defining cancers and NADCs, long-term follow-up for therapy-related complications assumes greater importance.",2009,8
887,19725909,Favorable outcome of de novo hepatitis B infection after liver transplantation with lamivudine and adefovir therapy.,"De novo hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) always progresses to chronic hepatitis because of the patients' immunocompromised status, and only a few then acquire hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion even with efficient antiviral therapy. Here we reported the case of a liver transplant recipient with de novo HBV infection who had a favorable outcome after lamivudine (LAM) and adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) antiviral therapy. The patient received OLT because of end-stage primary biliary cirrhosis and was found to have de novo HBV infection 3 months later. She was treated with LAM, and her serum HBV DNA turned undetectable 2 weeks later. However, serum HBV DNA turned detectable again after 9 months of LAM therapy and a YMDD mutation was detected. The addition of ADV was efficient to treat LAM-resistant HBV. After 3 months of combination therapy, LAM was stopped and ADV monotherapy was continued. HBsAg seroconversion was achieved after an additional 12 months. The prevention and treatment of de novo HBV infection after OLT is discussed.",2009,12
888,19733945,Linezolid-associated acute interstitial nephritis and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome.,"Linezolid is a recent addition to the antibiotic armamentarium against Gram-positive bacteria, including multiresistant staphylococci and enterococci. Linezolid is relatively well tolerated and is not believed to be nephrotoxic. However, we report the case of an 88-year-old woman who was treated for prosthetic joint infection and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with vancomycin followed by linezolid therapy. On day 7 of linezolid treatment, the patient developed severe pruritus, macular rash, facial edema, eosinophilia, marked increase in serum creatinine level, and mild hepatitis. Renal biopsy showed acute interstitial nephritis with eosinophilic cells. Discontinuation of linezolid and a short course of prednisone led to rapid improvement of renal function. This case of linezolid-associated acute interstitial nephritis within the context of a drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome in a patient treated with linezolid raises concerns about the presumed renal safety of this drug. Clinicians should be aware of this potential life-threatening adverse reaction and monitor kidney function while patients are using linezolid.",2009,12
889,19745701,Reversible methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorder resembling advanced gastric cancer in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.,"A 73-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis had been treated with weekly low-dose methotrexate (MTX) for 5 years. She suffered from epigastric discomfort. Endoscopic examination revealed a tumor resembling advanced gastric cancer. Biopsy specimens showed atypical lymphoid cell infiltration. Immunohistological studies showed that these cells were positive for CD30 and CD79a, but not for CD15 or CD20. In situ hybridization identified Epstein-Barr virus latency-associated RNA expression in these cells. Clonally rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain JH gene was not detected by Southern blot analysis. She was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus-associated polymorphic lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) due to immunodeficiency caused by MTX administration. Cessation of MTX therapy led to complete regression of the tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first case of spontaneous remission of MTX-associated gastric LPD after discontinuation of MTX therapy. Increased awareness is needed on the possible occurrence of LPD resembling gastric cancer in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with MTX.",2009,10
890,19764104,Sorafenib induced tumor lysis syndrome in an advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patient.,"A 55-year-old male patient with hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis was found to have advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. His AFP was initially 9828 microg/L and rapidly dropped to 5597 microg/L in ten days after oral sorafenib treatment. However, he developed acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and hyperuricemia 30 d after receiving the sorafenib treatment. Tumor lysis syndrome was suspected and intensive hemodialysis was performed. Despite intensive hemodialysis and other supportive therapy, he developed multiple organ failure (liver, renal, and respiratory failure) and metabolic acidosis. The patient expired 13 d after admission.",2009,9
891,19775485,Are nasal decongestants safer than rhinitis? A case of oxymetazoline-induced syncope.,"Derivatives of Imidazoline usually act to stimulate peripheral alpha2 receptors causing vasoconstriction. In young children, however, they can also stimulate alpha2receptors in the cardiovascular and central nervous systems, possibly causing cardiovascular, neurological, and respiratory depression. These medications do not require medical prescriptions, so often parents use them, bypassing paediatricians. We report here a case of cardiovascular and neurological depression induced by oxymetalzoline in a toddler.",2009,12
892,19789166,Nitrofurantoin-induced acute liver damage in pregnancy.,"This article presents a rare case of acute toxic hepatitis in thirty-one-year old primigravida. In the 36th week of gestation, the patient was introduced nitrofurantoin 100 mg a day due to symptoms of dysuria and enterococcus isolated from urine culture. After induced delivery at term because of hypertension, repeated laboratory findings showed increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and negative hepatitis C and B markers. The patient was subicteric at the time. Coagulation and complete blood count values were within the normal range. Nitrofurantoin therapy was discontinued. Abdominal ultrasound was normal with the exception of a slight hepatomegaly without any lesions, focal or diffuse. Given that discontinuation of nitrofurantoin and introduction of methylprednisolon therapy significantly lowered liver enzyme levels, restoring most of them to normal, we concluded that this was probably the case of toxic liver damage caused by nitrofurantoin.",2009,9
893,19798640,Primary central nervous system lymphoma in a patient treated with natalizumab.,"A 40-year-old man with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) developed primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) after having received 21 doses of natalizumab monotherapy. PCNSL is a disease of the elderly, with the majority of patients being diagnosed in the 7th to 8th decade of life. Immunodeficiency, iatrogenic immunosuppression, and some autoimmune diseases are known as predisposing conditions, and in these patients PCNSL peaks in the 4th decade. Because there is no increased prevalence of PCNSL in MS, and the patient was otherwise not immunocompromised, an association between natalizumab therapy and PCNSL cannot be ruled out.",2009,9
894,19815480,Tolerance of sunitinib in dialyzed patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.,"The use of sunitinib in dialysis patients is poorly described but is of clinical importance. We report 2 cases of patients receiving sunitinib for metastatic renal cell carcinoma while undergoing dialysis. The first patient is undergoing hemodialysis and, though responding to sunitinib, is having significant fatigue and hypertension. The second patient underwent peritoneal dialysis and also had significant problems with hypertension. The tolerance of sunitinib in the setting of dialysis can be challenging as these interventions can have synergistic side effects. Close monitoring for toxicity and dosage manipulations might be required if such therapy is attempted.",2009,10
895,19826099,Severe apnea in an infant exposed to lamotrigine in breast milk.,"To report a case of severe apnea in an infant exposed to lamotrigine through breast-feeding.
A 16-day-old infant developed several mild episodes of apnea that culminated in a severe cyanotic episode requiring resuscitation. A thorough examination at the hospital gave no evidence of underlying diseases that could explain the reaction. The mother had used lamotrigine in increasing doses throughout pregnancy, and at the time of the apneic episodes, she used 850 mg/day. The infant was fully breast-fed, and the neonatal lamotrigine serum concentration was 4.87 microg/mL at the time of admission. Breast-feeding was terminated, and the infant fully recovered.
Although there are several reports on extensive passage of lamotrigine into breast milk, this is the first published report of a serious adverse reaction in a breast-fed infant. Lamotrigine clearance increases throughout pregnancy, and maternal dose increases are often necessary to maintain therapeutic effect. After delivery, clearance rapidly returns to preconception levels, enhancing the risk of adverse reactions in both mothers and breast-fed infants if the dose is not sufficiently reduced. In this case, the dose was slowly reduced after delivery, and the maternal lamotrigine serum concentration more than doubled in the week before the neonatal apneic episodes. A high lamotrigine concentration was detected in the breast milk, and the neonatal lamotrigine serum concentration was in the upper therapeutic range. The neonatal lamotrigine elimination half-life was approximately twice that seen in adults. The Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between apnea and exposure to lamotrigine through breast-feeding in this infant.
Infants can be exposed to clinically relevant doses of lamotrigine through breast-feeding. Individual risk/benefit assessment is important, and close monitoring of both mother and child is advisable, especially during the first 3 weeks postpartum.",2009,11
896,19838099,Dasatinib-induced pleural effusions: a lymphatic network disorder?,"Dasatanib, which has been approved for rescue therapy for patients with imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is a novel, orally available multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC family kinases (Quintas-Cardama et al, J Clin Oncol 2007;25:3908-14). It binds to both active and inactive conformations of the ABL gene and is 325 times more potent than imatinib in inhibiting the growth of BCR/ABL cells in vitro (Morelock and Sahn, Chest 1999;116:212-21; Huggins and Sahn, Clin Chest Med 2004;25:141-53). Although dasatinib is a generally well-tolerated drug in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive hematopoetic malignancies, pleural effusions have been frequently noted and have been reported in up to 35% of patients (Sahn SA. Drug-induced pleural disease. In: Camus P, Rosenow E, editors. Drug-induced iatrogenic lung disease. London: Hodder Arnold; 2009). Although there have been numerous reports of effusions, none have provided complete pleural fluid analysis; therefore, we report 2 patients with dasatinib-induced pleural effusion with complete pleural fluid analysis.",2009,11
897,19844714,Cisplatin administration following carboplatin desensitization failure in primary peritoneal cancer: a brief report.,"Platinum-based therapy is the cornerstone of ovarian cancer treatment. Development of platinum hypersensitivity can limit therapeutic options. In this brief report, we present case of successful cisplatin administration following two unsuccessful carboplatin desensitization attempts, and without the need for pre-treatment steroids.
Retrospective chart review was performed.
One case of recurrent primary peritoneal carcinoma previously treated with a carboplatin-based regimen, developed a platinum hypersensitivity. Two attempts at carboplatin desensitization were unsuccessful. Cisplatin was substituted and the patient achieved a complete response to therapy without further hypersensitivity.
Platinum-based therapies are vital to the treatment of primary peritoneal and ovarian carcinoma. Protocols that successfully incorporate platinum agents, despite a platinum hypersensitivity, are clinically relevant.",2010,7
898,19875411,Severe cardiomyopathy following treatment with the tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor adalimumab for Crohn's disease.,"Adalimumab belongs to the group of tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors and has been approved for the treatment Crohn's Disease since 2007. Herein we report a severe adverse reaction to adalimumab in a 25-year-old female patient. One week after the initial-dose of adalimumab (160 mg), which was initiated due to an acute exacerbation of Crohn's disease, the patient developed a fulminant cardiomyopathy. In severe cardiogenic shock, the patient required an extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation system for 8 days until cardiac recovery.",2009,11
899,19884751,Amikacin-induced type 5 Bartter-like syndrome with severe hypocalcemia.,"Aminoglycoside-induced renal toxicity is well known and may manifest with nonoliguric renal failure or renal tubular dysfunction. Aminoglycoside-induced renal tubular dysfunction could result in diffuse damage or manifest as a Fanconi-like syndrome, Bartter-like syndrome, or distal renal tubular acidosis. We discuss a patient who developed severe renal tubular dysfunction secondary to short-term therapy with Amikacin, resulting in refractory hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis, and polyuria. This constellation of biochemical abnormalities mimic Type 5 Bartter's syndrome, where there is activating mutation of the calcium sensing receptor in the thick ascending loop of Henle and the distal tubule. In this case this activation of the calcium sensing receptor was triggered by amikacin. This phenomenon has been described with gentamicin though never with amikacin. Recovery of the tubular dysfunction took 15 days following cessation of the offending drug, Amikacin.",0,0
900,1988604,Treatment of intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy with thrombin. Report of three patients.,"Of 165 consecutive patients undergoing computerized tomography- or magnetic resonance imaging-guided stereotactic brain biopsies at the Cleveland Clinic between June, 1987, and November, 1989, four patients (2.4%) developed arterial hemorrhage refractory to conventional efforts to secure hemostasis. Craniotomy was performed in one of these patients to control the hemorrhage; in the other three, 0.5 to 2 cc of thrombin (5000 U/cc) was slowly injected via the biopsy cannula, resulting in immediate control of bleeding in all three cases. Postoperatively, the first two patients treated with 1 to 2 cc of thrombin were slow to awaken; one had evidence of vasospasm by transcranial Doppler ultrasound studies and multiple infarcts on cranial computerized tomography, while the other had a moderate-sized frontal hematoma with intracranial hypertension. After prolonged recovery periods, only mild neurological deficits persisted in both patients. The third patient, treated with 0.5 cc of thrombin, had an uneventful postoperative course. Thrombin is highly effective for stopping intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy; however, it is a vasospastic agent and may have been responsible for the cerebral infarctions in one patient. Therefore, thrombin should be used only as a last resort, short of craniotomy, to control intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy.",1991,2
901,19892516,Ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis.,"Ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis is a rare side effect. It has only been described in 10 case reports since 1989. However, recently we were confronted with two cases within 1 month. In one patient the vasculitis resolved after termination of the ciprofloxacin therapy; in the other patient the ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis was superimposed on a severe forefoot infection, leading to progressive gangrene and a below-knee amputation. Ciprofloxacin is among the standard treatments for infected ischemic ulcers; in the rare case of ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis, it might be interpreted as progression of infection, instead of a complication of the treatment, thus leading to faulty diagnosis and treatment. The intention of this case report is to raise awareness for anyone prescribing ciprofloxacin as treatment for infected diabetic and ischemic ulcers.",2010,2
902,19897274,Interstitial pneumonia probably associated with sorafenib treatment: An alert of an adverse event.,"There has been no literature which reports a case of interstitial lung disease associated with sorafenib. However, a recent post-marketing survey in Japan revealed that interstitial pneumonia occurred in 4 among approximately 2 000 Japanese patients treated with sorafenib. In this article, we describe a Japanese patient with severe interstitial pneumonia probably caused by sorafenib treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Oncologists supervising future clinical trials for lung cancer should be alert to the fact that sorafenib can potentially induce serious interstitial lung disease, although this might depend on racial differences.",2010,2
903,19904536,Fatal gemcitabine-induced pulmonary toxicity in metastatic   gallbladder adenocarcinoma.,"Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy agent that may cause unpredictable side effects. In this report, we describe a fatal gemcitabine-induced pulmonary toxicity in a patient with gallbladder metastatic adenocarcinoma. A 72-year-old patient was submitted to an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and a tubular adenocarcinoma in the gallbladder was incidentally diagnosed. CT scan and ultrasound before the surgery did not show any tumor. After the surgery a Pet scan was positive for a hot-spot in the left colon. The colonic lesion was conveniently removed and the histology evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma tubular. The patient was then submitted to three sections of 1,600 mg/m2 of gemcitabine with intervals of 1 week. Three weeks later he developed severe respiratory distress. A helicoidal CT scan showed diffuse and severe interstitial pneumonitis, and lung biopsy confirmed accelerated usual interstitial pneumonia consistent with drug-induced toxicity. The patient presented unfavorable evolution with progressive worsening of respiratory function, hypotension, and renal failure. He died 1 month later in spite of methylprednisolone pulse therapy, large spectrum antimicrobial therapy, and full support of respiratory, hemodynamic and renal systems. Gemcitabine-induced pulmonary toxicity is usually a dramatic condition. Physicians should suspect pulmonary toxicity in patients with respiratory distress after gemcitabine chemotherapy, mainly in elderly patients.",2010,2
904,19915794,"Torsades de Pointes induced by a combination of garenoxacin and disopyramide and other cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A polypeptide-4-influencing drugs during hypokalemia due to licorice.","We report an 82-year-old man who developed ventricular tachycardia and Torsades de Pointes (TdP) after oral administration of garenoxacin, a novel quinolone antibiotic agent that differs from the third-generation quinolones, for pneumonia. He had hypokalemia (K 2.3 mmol/L) induced by licorice and also had received disopyramide for arrhythmia, bicalutamide for prostate cancer, and silodosin for prostate hypertrophy. After taking him off all drugs and administering spironolactone supplemented with potassium, his low serum potassium level was ameliorated. Therefore, although garenoxacin reportedly causes fewer adverse reactions for cardiac rhythms than third-generation quinolone antibiotics, one must be cautious of the interference of other drugs during hypokalemia in order to prevent TdP.",2010,4
905,1993143,Allergic contact and photocontact dermatitis due to psoralens in patients with psoriasis treated with topical PUVA.,"The incidence and clinical features of allergic contact and/or photocontact dermatitis due to psoralens were examined in 371 patients with psoriasis treated with topical PUVA. The psoralen derivatives used in the study were 8-methoxypsoralen (8MOP), 3-carbethoxypsoralen (3CPs), 4,6,4'-trimethylangelicin (TMA) and 7-methyl pyridopsoralen (MPP). Of 371 patients treated with 8MOP, three (0.8%) developed an acute dermatitis in the PUVA-treated areas. This incidence was significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than that for 3CPs (four of 10 patients) or that for TMA (six of 17 patients). None of the seven patients receiving MPP on PUVA had a reaction. It was confirmed that these dermatitis reactions were due to contact and/or photocontact allergy to psoralens by several methods that include patch and photopatch tests, photopatch test mapping, determination of the minimal erythema dose (MED) and immunohistochemistry.",1991,1
906,19935411,Hepatotoxicity after high-dose methylprednisolone for demyelinating disease.,"Liver toxicity, although not mentioned among the possible adverse effects of corticosteroids, has been occasionally reported in literature. We observed 2 cases of hepatotoxicity after a high-dose methylprednisolone treatment of a demyelinating disease and evaluated the potential relationship in the light of available evidence. The first patient developed a histologically documented acute hepatitis and recovered after 3 weeks. In the second patient, a mild augmentation of liver enzymes occurred, followed by normalization in a few days. The causal relationship between hepatotoxicity and methylprednisolone treatment was deemed probable in both cases. Careful review of the literature suggests that corticosteroid-induced liver damage may be more frequent than commonly believed.",0,0
907,19949685,Colonic mucosal necrosis following administration of calcium polystryrene sulfonate (Kalimate) in a uremic patient.,"Colonic necrosis is known as a rare complication following the administration of Kayexalate (sodium polystryrene sulfonate) in sorbitol. We report a rare case of colonic mucosal necrosis following Kalimate (calcium polystryrene sulfonate), an analogue of Kayexalate without sorbitol in a 34-yr-old man. He had a history of hypertension and uremia. During the management of intracranial hemorrhage, hyperkalemia developed. Kalimate was administered orally and as an enema suspended in 20% dextrose water to treat hyperkalemia. Two days after administration of Kalimate enema, he had profuse hematochezia, and a sigmoidoscopy showed diffuse colonic mucosal necrosis in the rectum and sigmoid colon. Microscopic examination of random colonic biopsies by two consecutive sigmoidoscopies revealed angulated crystals with a characteristic crystalline mosaic pattern on the ulcerated mucosa, which were consistent with Kayexalate crystals. Hematochezia subsided with conservative treatment after a discontinuance of Kalimate administration.",2009,12
908,19995222,Clozapine-induced tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenic patients taking clozapine as a first-line antipsychotic drug.,"Clozapine causes few extrapyramidal symptoms and is recommended as a treatment drug for severe tardive dyskinesia (TD). However, several case reports have suggested that clozapine could also cause TD. We investigated whether clozapine used as a first-line antipsychotic drug can cause TD.
We identified 101 patients at Yanbian Socio-Mental Hospital and Yanbian Brain Hospital in China who had received clozapine as a primary antipsychotic drug since their first episode of illness and evaluated the prevalence rate, type, and severity of TD using the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS). The criterion for TD was a score of > or = 3 on one item or 2 on two or more items of the ESRS.
The mean age and duration of illness of the patients were 38.93+/-8.36 and 12.88+/-6.90 years, respectively. The mean duration of clozapine treatment was 12.10+/-6.26 years. The prevalence of TD was 3.96% (4/101). Compared to patients without TD, patients with TD had a long duration of illness and clozapine treatment; all had the orolingual type of TD. TD was relatively mild, with a mean score of 4.75, and tended to accentuate with an activation procedure of rapid pronation and supination of the hands.
These results suggest that clozapine may cause TD; however, the prevalence is low and the severity is relatively mild, with no or mild self-reported discomfort. Therefore, we recommend that regular examination for TD using the activation procedure should be performed in patients who use clozapine on a long-term basis.",2009,0

Here we report a patient with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia who developed acute focal myositis, synovitis, and possible vasculitis, after receiving all-trans retinoic acid therapy. We review the existing literature on this rare clinical entity, all-trans retinoic acid-induced myositis. This condition can manifest as fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and Sweet syndrome, accompanied by distinct magnetic resonance findings involving the lower extremity musculature. Treatment consists of discontinuation of the offending drug and often high dose corticosteroids.",2009,10
910,20020238,Retinopathy in hepatitis C patients due to combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.,"To assess the nature, incidence, and risk factors of retinopathy associated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients.
Thirty-two patients with chronic hepatitis C were examined prospectively for changes in fundus findings while they were being treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Patients were followed with sequential ocular examinations for a maximum of 36 weeks.
Eleven of the 32 patients (34.4%) developed retinopathy. Cotton-wool spots were found in six patients, retinal hemorrhages in four, and branch retinal vein occlusion in one (one eye). Hypertension was found to be the most significant risk factor for developing retinopathy.
Significant ocular complications such as an irreversible decrease of visual acuity may develop in patients treated with pegylated interferon. The valid risk factor for developing retinopathy is hypertension. The high rate of retinopathy in patients with hypertension suggests that patients should be carefully monitored.",2009,11
911,20038831,Administration of cisplatin in three patients with carboplatin hypersensitivity: is skin testing useful?,"Carboplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent approved in the first-line setting of numerous malignancies. Hypersensitivity to carboplatin has been reported in up to 44% of patients receiving this antineoplastic agent, usually occurring after several courses of treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of skin tests in ruling out cross-reaction to cisplatin to continue platinum-based chemotherapy in patients who are responsive to these agents. Prick tests and intradermal tests with a series of dilutions of carboplatin and cisplatin were performed on three patients who had exhibited medium and severe hypersensitivity reactions to carboplatin. Prick tests were negative in both the antineoplastic agents. Intradermal tests with carboplatin were positive in all three patients and negative with cisplatin. In all patients, the administration of cisplatin instead of carboplatin was well tolerated without the need of premedication. In conclusion, intradermal skin tests can be a useful tool for detecting a potential cross-reaction between platinum salts. It allows safe administration of a different platinum agent in patients who seem to benefit from platinum-based therapy. Discontinuation of chemotherapy, desensitization protocols and steroid premedication can be avoided.",2010,3
912,20065266,"Aseptic meningitis, hemolytic anemia, hepatitis, and orthostatic hypotension in a patient treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.","The case of a patient who developed aseptic meningitis, hemolytic anemia, hepatitis, and orthostatic hypotension simultaneously during treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is described.
A healthy 37-year-old African- American man was receiving treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double strength. This was the patient's first experience with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, and he was not taking any other medications during the treatment period. He had been taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for approximately eight days when he revisited his family physician, complaining of headaches, dizziness, difficulty with speech, weakness, and itching on the trunk of his body and legs, where a maculopapular rash was noted. Orthostatic hypotension was also noted at that visit, with a standing blood pressure measurement of 95/80 mm Hg. Based on these findings and since the patient had no signs of infection, his physician instructed him to discontinue the drug. The patient was admitted to the emergency department of a local hospital within two days due to ongoing headache, elevated temperature, and nuchal rigidity, symptoms suggestive of meningitis. Because of the presence of hemolysis, the patient underwent testing for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, for which he tested positive. The patient was discharged five days after admission and referred to a hematology clinic for follow-up. The patient has since returned to his routines of daily living and has reported no fatigue or other lingering adverse symptoms.

915,20110001,Kaposi's sarcoma in a patient treated with imatinib mesylate for chronic myeloid leukemia.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder primarily characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome resulting from a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22. This translocation determines a fusion gene, bcr-abl, which encodes a constitutively active protein, tyrosine kinase, resulting in decreased apoptosis, defective adhesion, and genomic instability in transformed cells. The tyrosine kinase activity and its effects represent a potential pharmacologic target of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib. Flare of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is well described in immunosuppressed patients treated with corticosteroids and rituximab, but has not yet been reported during treatment with imatinib.
We report a case of cutaneous KS lesions in a patient affected by CML treated with imatinib.
A 61-year-old white male patient (weight, 90 kg) was diagnosed with CML in March 2006 at the Division of Hematology, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata,"" Rome, Italy. He was treated with imatinib 400 mg/d, which improved his general condition with few adverse effects. After 12 months of treatment, molecular biology showed an important reduction in the peripheral blood of the fusion oncoprotein bcr-abl p210-b3a2. However, at the same time, multiple cutaneous violaceous papular-nodular lesions appeared on his left forearm. A punch biopsy showed the presence of KS, whereas a polymerase chain reaction assay documented the presence of human herpes virus type 8 (HHV8) DNA in the skin lesion. Serologic HIV was negative and HHV8 viremia was under the limit of quantitation of the assay. Total body computed tomography scan did not reveal any mucosal or visceral lesion.
We present a case of a patient with CML who developed KS 12 months after starting treatment with imatinib 400 mg/d. The mechanism behind the development of the cutaneous lesions is unclear, and could have either a casual clinical association or be related to the study drug. According to the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, the development of KS in this case was probably associated with the imatinib treatment (score, 5-8).",2009,11

Interferon-based treatments have the potential to decrease the burden of disease, but are complicated by side effects, including neuropsychiatric symptoms.
The authors described a case of interferon-induced psychosis as a framework to review the literature and discuss the decision to pursue antiviral treatment in psychiatrically ill patients with hepatitis C.
The authors followed a patient with chronic HCV who received interferon and ribavirin and who developed hallucinations ultimately requiring psychiatric hospitalization.
Despite treatment with various neuroleptics, the psychosis resolved only when the interferon/ribavirin were discontinued.
Psychiatric illness should not rule out the possibility of interferon-based therapy, but it calls for close integration of psychiatric and medical care and individualized decision-making based on the biological and psychosocial circumstances of each case.",0,0

Its use is however not without adverse effect particularly bone marrow aplasia leading to varying degrees of cytopenias predominantly anaemia. This calls for adequate evaluation and monitoring of patients on this drug. Its major side effect of anaemia limits its use in some patients. We report a case of Zidovudine induced anaemia and bone marrow aplasia in a patient infected with HIV.
The Hospital case note of a 27 year old widow with HIV infection and anaemia, who has been on HAART (Zidovudine, Lamivudine and Nevirapine) for one year, was reviewed.
She presented with severe anaemia (PCV of 0.05), White cell and platelet counts were within normal limits and reticulocyte count of 0.001%. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were diagnostic of pure red cell aplasia on a background hypocellular marrow. She was transfused with four (4) units of packed cells and Zidovudine was replaced with Stavudine. She made remarkable improvement and remains transfusion independent afterwards.
Zidovudine is well a known cause of anaemia and thus should be used with caution in the initiation of antiretroviral therapy.",0,0
919,20126479,Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics may detect hydroxychloroquine retinal toxicity before symptomatic vision loss.,"To describe spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and adaptive optics (AO) imaging in hydroxychloroquine retinal toxicity.
Two patients with long-term hydroxychloroquine use, subtle perifoveal ophthalmoscopic pigmentary changes, and bilateral perifoveal defects on automated Humphrey visual field (HVF) 10-2 perimetry were imaged using SD-OCT and AO.
SD-OCT images demonstrated loss of photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction and a downward ""sink-hole"" displacement of inner retinal structures in areas of hydroxychloroquine toxicity corresponding to HVF 10-2 defects and ophthalmoscopic clinical examination findings. SD-OCT irregularities in the IS/OS junction were also seen in areas not detected on HVF 10-2. AO images showed disruption of the cone photoreceptor mosaic in areas corresponding to HVF 10-2 defects and SD-OCT IS/OS junction abnormalities. Additionally, irregularities in the cone photoreceptor density and mosaic were seen in areas with normal HVF 10-2 and SD-OCT findings.
SD-OCT and AO detected abnormalities that correlate topographically with visual field loss from hydroxychloroquine toxicity as demonstrated by HVF 10-2 and may be useful in the detection of subclinical abnormalities that precede symptoms or objective visual field loss.",2009,12

Administration of infliximab and adalimumab gave excellent clinical response but was discontinued due to adverse events. Introduction of etanercept was also clinically effective but followed by development of severe heart failure. Discontinuation of etanercept led to control of heart function.

922,20154441,Ischemic stroke associated with cough and cold preparation containing methylephedrine and supplement containing Chinese herbal drugs.,"Methylephedrine is generally harmless and is contained in many cough and cold preparations. Likewise, Chinese herbal drugs are considered to be effective and to have few side effects. A 32-year-old woman experienced ischemic stroke attributed to concomitant administration of a cough and cold preparation containing methylephedrine and a supplement containing Chinese herbal drugs. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed acute infarctions bilaterally in the cerebellum. Conventional angiography and magnetic resonance angiography showed transient stenosis of the left vertebral artery. These findings suggested vasospasm or dissection, presumably related to hypertension and/or angiitis or vasoconstriction of large cerebral arteries leading to local thrombosis as a result of stasis and sympathomimetic-induced platelet activation. Combining methylephedrine and Chinese herbal drugs might carry a risk of stroke.",2010,0
923,2016556,Chronic nausea and morphine-6-glucuronide.,"Morphine-6-glucuronide is an active metabolite of morphine that has analgesic properties and is measurable in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients treated with this opioid. Decreased clearance of the compound has been observed in patients with renal insufficiency, and this has been associated with an increase in the ratio of morphine-6-glucuronide to morphine. Clinical effects from accumulation of morphine-6-glucuronide have not been described with the exception of case reports in which patients with renal failure were noted to develop opioid toxicity with high plasma levels of the metabolite and low levels of the parent drug. We describe a patient who experienced chronic nausea and an episode of confusion while treated with a small, stable dose of oral morphine in the setting of mild renal insufficiency. Relatively high levels of morphine-6-glucuronide were measured and all symptoms resolved promptly as the concentration of this metabolite declined. This case provides suggestive evidence that morphine-6-glucuronide can produce clinically significant effects in patients with mild renal insufficiency.",1991,4
924,20171144,Lacosamide intoxication in attempted suicide.,"The anticonvulsant drug lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels and has been shown to be an effective add-on treatment for partial-onset seizures. Common adverse events (frequency 10%) of lacosamide doses up to 600 mg/day include nonspecific central nervous system effects (e.g., dizziness, ataxia, diplopia, and somnolence). There are no human data regarding the safety of very high dosages of lacosamide. We report the clinical course of a patient with bitemporal epilepsy who ingested 12 g of lacosamide, 56 g of gabapentin, 2g of topiramate, and 2.8 g of zonisamide during a suicide attempt. The patient was found comatose and experienced repeated generalized tonic-clonic seizures, aspiration with subsequent pneumonia, hypotension, and an increase in PR interval. Complete physical recovery occurred after several days of supportive treatment. We conclude that intoxication with lacosamide, in combination with overdoses of multiple AEDs, can be survived without sequelae, even after ingestion of 12 g lacosamide.",2010,4

929,20203465,Case report: acute renal failure after administering intravenous immunoglobulin.,"We report the case of an 87-year-old white woman with myasthenia gravis who presented with nausea, shortness of breath, azotemia, and hyperkalemia shortly after completing a course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). She had been receiving monthly transfusions of IVIG, but this time had received daily infusions for 5 days rather than 1 day. She had received this same dose in the past without incident. Her history was significant for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, chronic steroid use, and recurrent urinary tract infection. On examination, she was slightly confused, mildly dehydrated, had a grade II systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border, had bilateral and symmetric mild weakness of the upper and lower extremities, and exhibited mild edema of the lower extremities. Before transfer from the emergency room, she was found to have an elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine of 55 and 5.8 mg/dL (19.6 mmol/L and 512.7 micromol/L, respectively).

933,20298401,Fatal interstitial lung disease after erlotinib administration in a patient with radiation fibrosis.,"Although gefitinib used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer is a well-known cause of interstitial lung disease (ILD), few case reports on erlotinib-induced ILD have been issued. The common risk factor of both of these two drug-induced ILDs is idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, but ILD in a patient with radiation fibrosis has not been previously reported.
Report of a case.
We recently experienced a case of fatal erlotinib-induced ILD, diagnosed based on clinical and radiologic findings, which occurred in a patient with radiation fibrosis. A 50-year-old male patient was started on erlotinib as a third-line chemotherapy. Six days after taking erlotinib, a chest radiograph showed rapid progression of reticular infiltration in both lung fields. High-resolution computed tomography scan findings were consistent with ILD, which was sufficient to diagnose as erlotinib-induced ILD. The patient died of respiratory failure after 8 days of steroid infusion and erlotinib discontinuation.
Our case shows a fatal side effect of erlotinib. This case had radiation fibrosis, so we suggest that radiation fibrosis may be another contributor of the occurrence of ILD in patients taking erlotinib.",2009,7
934,20338114,Concentrated topical epinephrine is safe in endoscopic sinus surgery.,"The safety of topical epinephrine (1:1000 concentration) has recently been called into question. No objective data have been presented examining this issue.
We retrospectively reviewed all cases of endoscopic sinus surgery performed by the senior authors at their respective institutions. Perioperative records were reviewed for use of topical 1:1000 epinephrine and for any intraoperative or postoperative complications related to its use.
During the study periods, 1998 cases of endoscopic sinus surgery were identified where topical 1:1000 epinephrine was used. Two complications were identified (0.1%), one at each institution. One patient suffered coronary artery vasospasm, attributed to the use of topical 1:1000 epinephrine during surgery. The other patient developed transient intraoperative hypertension immediately after inadvertent submucosal injection of concentrated epinephrine. This event was caused by an erroneous switch with the 1% lidocaine/1:100,000 solution. This error occurred early in the institution's experience with concentrated topical epinephrine. After implementation of additional preventative safeguards, no further errors or complications have occurred.
Concentrated epinephrine has the potential for complications when used during endoscopic sinus surgery. Nevertheless, with appropriate safeguards described in this study, its topical use is safe.",0,0

939,20397038,Normalization of generalized retinal function and progression of maculopathy after cessation of therapy in a case of severe hydroxychloroquine retinopathy with 19 years follow-up.,"A 40-year-old Caucasian female was first seen 20 years ago for a routine ocular screening in relation to hydroxychloroquine treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus. Her daily dose was 600 mg (or 12 mg/kg of body weight/day) of hydroxychloroquine. Three years later, she complained of mild visual loss in the right eye. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 0.9 in the right (RE) and 1.0 in the left eye (LE). In addition, she had a central scotoma (RE > LE) on automated visual field analysis (Humphrey central 30 degrees ). On fundoscopy and fluorescein angiography, the first signs of a bilateral bull's eye maculopathy were detected. A decreased Arden ratio on EOG (<1.50) was found with an accompanying decreased amplitude of the scotopic b-wave on full-field electroretinography in both eyes. Consequently, the treatment was immediately stopped. During the following years, the patient was retested regularly. After more than 18 years after cessation of the drug, most tests showed a further deterioration, including best-corrected visual acuity (RE: 0.1; LE: 0.7). On visual field testing, a progressive evolution to a total and absolute central scotoma in the RE (central 10 degrees ) and an annular scotoma in the LE became apparent. In contrast, a partial recovery of the Arden ratio of the EOG to 1.8 in both eyes was seen. In addition, a partial recovery of the scotopic b-wave full-field ERG was noted 19 years after cessation of treatment. At retest visits respectively 18, 19 and 20 years after cessation of hydroxychloroquine, a multifocal electroretinogram was performed in combination with colour vision tests and contrast sensitivity measurements.",2010,6
940,20412003,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-induced hepatotoxicity in a pediatric patient.,"Due to the escalating rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is being used increasingly in the pediatric population for skin and soft tissue infections. Although this combination agent has been associated with a hypersensitivity syndrome involving cutaneous skin eruptions, pediatric cases of TMP-SMX-induced hepatotoxicity are rare. We describe a relatively healthy, 9-year-old boy who developed a CA-MRSA skin and soft tissue infection and was treated with TMP-SMX. After 14 days of therapy, he was taken to the emergency department with a 3-day history of fever, headache, and neck pain. He was diagnosed with a viral syndrome, acetaminophen was prescribed, and he was sent home. Three days later, the patient returned to the emergency department with fever, vomiting, decreased energy and appetitie, and suprapubic abdominal pain, and he was hospitalized. Laboratory test results revealed elevated liver function test values. After other potential causes of liver toxicity were excluded, TMP-SMX was determined to be the cause of his acute liver toxicity. The drug was discontinued, his symptoms resolved, and his liver function tests returned to normal. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship (score of 5) between the patient's development of hepatotoxicity and the TMP-SMX therapy. This rare adverse reaction to TMP-SMX has been reported in adults; however, to our knowledge, it has been reported in only five other children. Due to the increasing use of TMP-SMX in children, clinicians should be aware of this potentially life-threatening, immunemediated hypersensitivity reaction. Fortunately, however, the hepatotoxicity appears to resolve after discontinuation of the TMP-SMX therapy in most reported cases. This case report illustrates the importance of early detection of drug-induced hepatotoxicity and timely drug discontinuation to prevent the need for liver transplantation.",2010,5
941,2042691,Goiter and hypothyroidism during re-treatment with amiodarone in a patient who previously experienced amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.,"A 55-year-old woman who had been receiving treatment with amiodarone for recurrent supraventricular tachyarrhythmias became thyrotoxic after 30 months of treatment. The thyroid gland was not enlarged or tender. Amiodarone was discontinued, and thyrotoxicosis gradually abated. A thyroid scan performed at that time revealed a gland of normal size and texture. Six months later, amiodarone treatment was reinstated due to life-threatening tachyarrhythmia; however, the patient remained euthyroid. Three years later, multinodular goiter began to develop, and 5 years after that, the patient became hypothyroid. Tests for thyroid autoantibodies, as well as inhibitory and stimulatory antibodies, were negative, and fine needle aspiration biopsy revealed an adenomatous goiter. Treatment with amiodarone was continued; however, therapy with L-thyroxin was initiated, followed by a complete regression of the goiter. The patient has since required a maintenance dose of L-thyroxin. The possible mechanisms by which iodine-containing drugs induce thyroid disfunction are reviewed, suggesting this case was caused by an alteration in the sensitivity of the intrinsic autoregulation of the thyroid gland to iodine.",1991,6

Since these drugs are used widely in the pediatric transplantation population, this report serves to heighten awareness of this debilitating phenomenon, and to stress the importance of exercising caution when sirolimus and tacrolimus are administered in combination to pediatric patients.",2010,1
943,2048579,Effects of the methylprednisolone pulse therapy on renal function.,"The effect of the methylprednisolone (MP) pulse therapy on renal function was examined in 15 patients with renal or collagen disease. Three nephrotic patients who had reduced renal function and active renal disease with progressive deterioration of renal function prior to the use of MP developed transient renal failure following an MP pulse therapy. The renal failure in each case was reversed by discontinuation of MP and/or by forced diuresis using albumin and furosemide. We examined the correlations between the individual changes in serum creatinine (Scr), body weight (BW) and urine volume (UV) before and after the pulse therapy and other laboratory data such as Scr, total serum protein and albumin. There were significant correlations between a change in Scr on the one hand and changes in BW and UV, Scr and serum albumin on the other. These findings mean that the effect of the MP pulse therapy on renal function depends on the clinical state of the patient and that renal deterioration after the pulse therapy may be more marked in patients who are more nephrotic and more impaired in renal function and suggest that increasing sodium and water retention during an MP therapy and the associated renal interstitial edema, proposed as one of the mechanisms of acute renal failure occurring in patients with minimal-change nephrotic syndrome, may be responsible for the MP-induced transient renal failure.",1991,0
944,2051906,Reversible cholestasis with bile duct injury following azathioprine therapy. A case report.,"A 67-year-old patient, with primary polymyositis and without previous evidence of liver disease, developed clinical and biochemical features of severe cholestasis 3 months after initiation of azathioprine therapy. Liver biopsy showed cholestasis with both cytological and architectural alterations of interlobular bile ducts. Azathioprine withdrawal resulted after 7 weeks in the resolution of clinical and biochemical abnormalities. It is believed that this is the first reported case of reversible azathioprine-induced cholestasis associated with histological evidence of bile duct injury.",1991,4
945,2063999,A case of the Rett syndrome with acute encephalopathy induced during calcium hopantenate treatment.,"We report a girl with the Rett syndrome who had acute encephalopathy probably induced by calcium hopantenate (HOPA). This 4-year-6-month-old girl had a history of moderate developmental delay and had received HOPA administration when first admitted at 2 years 6 months of age with hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, lactic and pyruvic acidemia, and non-ketotic dicarboxylic aciduria. After this episode, she showed the rapid destructive stage of the Rett syndrome, i.e., severe psychomotor retardation with loss of speech, peculiar stereotypic hand movements, autistic behavior and seizures. Despite subsequent investigations, including analysis of urinary metabolites of organic and amino acids, measurement of serum carnitine and a muscle biopsy, we could not clarify the primary metabolic abnormalities in this girl.",1991,0
946,2076372,Persistent light reactivity from systemic quinine.,A 41-year-old black female with psoriasis developed photosensitivity and a Koebner reaction while receiving phototherapy. She had been receiving oral quinine intermittently for muscle cramps. Photobiological evaluation revealed a strongly positive photopatch test to quinine sulfate and a marked persistent reduction in the minimal erythema dose to solar-simulated radiation in the uninvolved skin. There were no abnormal reactions to UVA. The photosensitivity is still present 3 years after the withdrawal of quinine. These features are similar to those observed previously in persistent light reactors to topical photosensitizers.,1990,8
947,2104570,Secondary hematologic neoplasm after intravesical chemotherapy for superficial bladder carcinoma.,"Two cases are reported of patients who developed a hematologic malignancy several years after intravesical chemotherapy of superficial bladder cancer with etoglucid, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C. In one patient, karyotypic abnormalities (-5, 7q-) typical of a therapy induced malignancy were associated with rapid progression of a refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation to an acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. Intravesical chemotherapy may be associated with a risk of secondary malignancy.",1990,1
948,2113320,Subglottic stenosis in Wegener's granulomatosis: development during cyclophosphamide treatment with response to carbon dioxide laser therapy.,A patient with Wegener's granulomatosis rapidly developed a circumferential subglottic stenosis while on a cyclophosphamide regimen that had caused resolution of systemic symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates. The stenosis developed in the area of previously noted tracheal ulceration and responded satisfactorily to carbon dioxide laser therapy.,1990,4
949,2116935,Splenic hemorrhage: a complication of tissue plasminogen activator treatment.,"Thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute myocardial infarction may result in major bleeding complications such as gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding. A case is described of severe splenic hemorrhage and rupture which developed 3 h after completion of tPA infusion for suspected acute myocardial infarction. The patient developed hypovolemic shock with abdominal pain and distension and further evidence of myocardial necrosis. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen was helpful in elucidating the diagnosis, and surgical splenectomy resulted in a good patient outcome, though the period of hypotension had increased the extent of myocardial necrosis.",1990,6
950,2140997,Severe hepatitis caused by cyproterone acetate.,A case of severe acute hepatitis caused by cyproterone acetate in a 71 year old man with prostatic carcinoma is reported with a review of the literature on hepatic reactions to this drug. The association between the use of cyproterone acetate and liver abnormalities is poorly documented. This is the fourth published report of adverse hepatic reaction to cyproterone acetate and it substantiates other evidence that cyproterone acetate is potentially hepatotoxic. Monitoring of liver function tests should be mandatory in patients receiving high doses of cyproterone acetate; the drug should be withdrawn immediately if abnormal liver function tests are found.,1990,5
951,2144305,"Transient, nonpigmenting fixed drug eruption caused by radiopaque contrast media.","A unique case of a transient, nonpigmenting fixed drug eruption caused by the radiopaque contrast medium iothalamate is reported. The patient had on the medial aspect of the thigh a fixed solitary, recurrent, indurated, erythematous plaque, which resolved within 2 days. The scant literature available on nonpigmenting fixed drug eruptions is reviewed.",1990,8
952,2147700,Widespread dermatophyte infections that mimic collagen vascular disease.,This article reports the cases of two patients in whom a widespread dermatophyte infection mimicked the cutaneous lesions of their underlying collagen vascular disease. Griseofulvin may be associated with an increased incidence of adverse cutaneous reactions in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. One patient with systemic lupus erythematosus developed erythema multiforme after taking griseofulvin.,1990,11
953,2154663,Radiotherapy enhances the toxicity of aminoglutethimide.,"We report a case of radiotherapy-enhanced aminoglutethimide skin toxicity in a patient with metastatic breast cancer. This patient was started on aminoglutethimide 6 days prior to radiation therapy, for painful bone metastasis. On day 7 of radiation therapy, she developed an extensive erythematous maculopapular rash over her face, trunk, and extremities. The rash was confluent over the radiation ports, both anteriorly and posteriorly. Aminoglutethimide was discontinued until completion of radiotherapy, and the rash resolved. Concomitant irradiation apparently enhanced the skin toxicity of aminoglutethimide or possibly aminoglutethimide had a radiosensitizing role in this patient.",1990,0
954,2161782,Four case reports presenting new acquisitions on the association between breast and endometrial carcinoma.,"In recent years, the association between breast and endometrial cancer has been the subject of many studies. The present report describes four cases of this association in which tamoxifen had been administered to all of the patients. Data have been published regarding the possibility that tamoxifen may be responsible for the subsequent development of carcinoma of the corpus uteri in these patients. The authors intend to carry out a case-control study on patients treated with tamoxifen for breast carcinoma to reveal the possible presence of endometrial carcinoma.",1990,6
955,2196696,Disulfiram-induced hepatitis.,"We reported a case of disulfiram-induced hepatitis with unique clinical features and compared our case with others in the literature. Our patient had headache, mild fever, nausea, vomiting, rash, and eosinophilia after 3 weeks of disulfiram therapy. Subsequent liver biopsy showed low-grade lobular hepatitis. After disulfiram therapy was discontinued, symptoms subsided and results of liver function tests returned to normal.",1990,7
956,2204409,Methotrexate-induced leukoencephalopathy is treatable with high-dose folinic acid: a case report and analysis of the literature.,"An episode of leukoencephalopathy is reported in a 13-year-old girl who, after standard radiotherapy for a posterior fossa medulloblastoma, received 8 treatments with a protocol containing a 4-hour infusion of 500 mg/m2 methotrexate and 12 mg intrathecal methotrexate. The leukoencephalopathy, documented clinically and by CT and EEG, cleared after 2350 mg of leucovorin (citrovorum factor, folinic acid) was given in addition to the 135 mg given as part of the therapy. A review of the literature suggests that leukoencephalopathy may be prevented by high doses of leucovorin and can be treated by high doses, if lower doses were used initially. When high dose leucovorin was not used, residual neurological damage is not unusual.",1990,0
957,2212262,White clot syndrome and continuous arteriovenous haemofiltration.,Severe heparin associated thrombocytopenia is a rare complication of heparin therapy. We report a patient who developed heparin associated thrombocytopenia during continuous arteriovenous haemofiltration and discuss its implications and alternative anticoagulant treatment.,1990,0
958,2219619,Acute aluminum toxicity after continuous intravesical alum irrigation for hemorrhagic cystitis.,An encephalopathy and cardiomyopathy developed in a seventeen-year-old girl with chemotherapy-induced renal failure while receiving an intravesical aluminum infusion for hemorrhagic cystitis. Premortem serum and postmortem tissue aluminum levels were markedly elevated. It is likely that her inability to excrete absorbed aluminum contributed to her death. Aluminum infusions should be used with caution in patients with renal failure.,1990,10
959,2224786,Chemotherapy-related hemolytic-uremic syndrome after the treatment of head and neck cancer. A case report.,"A 62-year-old woman who was being treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck developed a chemotherapy-related hemolytic-uremic syndrome during the second cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, bleomycin, and methotrexate. Though the syndrome was suspected early, attempts at reversing the hematologic and renal abnormalities were unsuccessful. At postmortem examination, the characteristic microvascular lesions of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome were found in the kidneys.",1990,11
960,2229534,Severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption.,A severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption is described. Data are presented to show a significant absorption of lidocaine through diseased skin when lidocaine cream is used as a local anesthetic. Awareness of this route of intoxication might be important in patients in whom neurologic or psychiatric symptoms develop while large amounts of lidocaine cream are being used.,1990,11
961,2234880,Nitrendipine-induced gingival hyperplasia. First case report.,"Drug-induced gingival hyperplasia is well documented within the literature. It has been associated with phenytoin, cyclosporine, and calcium channel blocking agents. Nitrendipine is an experimental calcium channel blocking agent that also appears to cause the side effect of drug-induced gingival hyperplasia. The clinical and histologic presentation of this side effect and possible biochemical mechanisms of pathogenesis are discussed.",1990,11
962,2241449,Sulfadiazine crystalluria revisited. The treatment of Toxoplasma encephalitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.,"Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis is an important opportunistic infection in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, estimated to occur in 20,000 to 40,000 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in the United States by 1991. The combination of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine is regarded as the treatment of choice. Acute renal failure due to crystal deposition in the urinary tract was well described 30 to 40 years ago and is likely to resurface as a clinical entity if appropriate prophylactic measures are not taken. We describe two cases of sulfadiazine-induced crystalluria and renal failure in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, review the pertinent literature, and discuss the pathogenesis. Recommendations are made for the prophylaxis and treatment of sulfadiazine-related renal toxic reaction. Physicians using this ""new"" drug must be aware of the potential danger of sulfonamide-induced injury to the urinary tract.",1990,11
963,2250853,Glaucoma secondary to epithelial downgrowth and 5-fluorouracil.,"Since epithelial downgrowth involves an actively proliferating intraocular tissue, it is possible that the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil may inhibit it. We report a case of secondary glaucoma caused by epithelial downgrowth in which filtration surgery was performed with adjunctive use of subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil. On cessation of the injections, the retrocorneal membrane grew rapidly to involve the entire posterior cornea. The eye eventually became blind and painful and was enucleated. The use of 5-fluorouracil given in the usual manner appears to have been a failure.",1990,10
964,2257522,Antacid and sucralfate-induced hypophosphatemic osteomalacia: a case report and review of the literature.,"A 42-year-old woman presented to our institution with a 2-week history of bone pain in the lower extremities. Her history was remarkable for duodenal ulcer and long-term treatment with a magnesium-aluminum hydroxide antacid (Maalox) and sucralfate. Initial laboratory studies showed severe hypophosphatemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Bone scan showed multiple areas of increased uptake consistent with osteomalacia and microfractures. The patient recovered completely following withdrawal of antacids and sucralfate and short-term treatment with phosphate. Although hypophosphatemia induced by aluminum-containing antacids is rare, treatment of peptic ulcer disease with a combination of two aluminum-containing agents may increase the risk of clinically significant hypophosphatemia. Awareness of this condition is important, because early recognition can prevent morbidity and lead to safe and effective treatment.",1990,11
965,2276822,Cardiobacterium hominis endocarditis in a patient with a hypersensitivity reaction to penicillin. Successful treatment with partial resection of the posterior mitral valve leaflet and antibiotic therapy with cefazolin.,"A 43-year-old patient with preexisting mitral valve prolapse and Cardiobacterium hominis endocarditis with partial destruction of the posterior mitral valve leaflet is described. Successful treatment was achieved with partial resection of the posterior mitral valve leaflet and antibiotic therapy. Because of a hypersensitivity reaction, initial therapy with penicillin G and gentamicin was stopped and substituted with cefazolin. No relapse of endocarditis was observed after 12 months of follow-up. Using micro broth dilution technique the isolated strain was shown to be most susceptible to penicillin G, cephalothin, and ciprofloxacin, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.00025, 0.004, and 0.002 mg/l, respectively; and with minimal bactericidal concentrations (99.9% killing) of 0.25, 0.12, and 0.008 mg/l, respectively. We conclude that cephalosporins of the first generation or ciprofloxacin may be good alternatives to penicillin G in the treatment of C. hominis infection in patients known to be hypersensitive to penicillin.",0,0
966,228648,Maternal immunosuppression and cytomegalovirus infection of the fetus.,Prenatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection associated with severe brain damage was detected in an infant whose mother had been treated with prednisolone and azathioprine for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Serology showed that maternal CMV infection had been acquired at least four months before pregnancy. Screening for CMV infection in pregnant women receiving immunosuppressive drugs is recommended.,1979,8
967,2292051,Acute coronary events following cisplatin-based chemotherapy.,"Six patients with no previous signs or symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease developed acute coronary ischemia/infarction shortly after cis-diamine-dichloroplatinum II (cisplatin) -based chemotherapy. In two patients this was the sole chemotherapeutic agent used. One patient underwent coronary angiography which disclosed no pathology, but following which, while on a calcium channel blocking agent regimen, he had an uneventful course of chemotherapy with cisplatin. Documentation of cisplatin-related vascular events is important in view of the growing number of patients who undergo cisplatin-based chemotherapy.",1990,0
968,2295443,Bowel perforation associated with intraperitoneal chromic phosphate instillation.,Intraperitoneal chromic phosphate is widely used as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of early-stage ovarian epithelial carcinoma. Delayed bowel injury is an infrequently observed complication of chromic phosphate administration. This report presents a case of colon perforation which occurred 4 months after treatment with intraperitoneal chromic phosphate for stage IB ovarian papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma.,1990,1
969,2297635,Early blindness and coma during intrathecal chemotherapy for meningeal carcinomatosis.,"A 35-year-old woman was treated with intraventricular methotrexate (MTX) with a total dose of 70 mg followed by cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) with a total dose of 80 mg for meningeal metastasis of breast carcinoma. Radiation therapy was not given. Despite a response of the meningeal tumor the patient developed in the third week of MTX treatment a progressive visual loss and loss of consciousness which worsened during subsequent Ara-C treatment and led to death within 3 weeks. Postmortem examination revealed only minimal neoplastic infiltration of the meninges. Multiple foci of axonal degeneration and demyelination were found in the optic nerves and chiasm, the superficial layers of the brainstem, and spinal cord and to some extent in other cranial nerves and spinal nerve roots. The possible causes of this previously unreported early complication are discussed.",1990,2
970,2299784,Bromide intoxication secondary to pyridostigmine bromide therapy.,"The diagnosis of bromide intoxication is often aided by the detection of a low or negative anion gap due to the laboratory detection of bromide as chloride. A 59-year-old woman with myasthenia gravis who received a large dose of pyridostigmine bromide developed postoperative psychosis and was diagnosed as having bromide intoxication. The diagnosis was suspected in the setting of a negative anion gap and only later confirmed by direct measurement of the serum bromide level. To our knowledge , this is the first reported case of bromide intoxication due to pyridostigmine bromide administration.",1990,2
971,2302898,Diazepam abuse in pregnant women on methadone maintenance. Implications for the neonate.,"The authors found that the course and treatment of narcotic withdrawal in two neonates was complicated by prenatal exposure to high doses of diazepam, or Valium (Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ). Both of the mothers were on methadone maintenance for narcotic dependency prior to the diagnosis of pregnancy. The authors documented maternal intake of diazepam in the range of 40-60 mg/day for a duration of 4-27 weeks prior to delivery. Both infants initially responded well to medical therapy for narcotic withdrawal, but at 7-14 days of age, withdrawal symptoms intensified, requiring an increase in the dosages of Paregoric (UDL Laboratories, Rockford, IL) and opium tincture in both infants and the addition of phenobarbital therapy in one infant. Both infants continued on medical therapy until they reached 1 month of age. Diazepam use by pregnant women can be associated with a later presentation of withdrawal symptoms in the neonate than that induced by the use of other drugs. Close follow-up during the first month of life is warranted for infants exposed to diazepam prenatally.",1990,2
972,2305654,Nimodipine: evidence for clinically significant gastrointestinal side-effects.,"Nimodipine, now widely used for treatment and prevention of cerebrovascular spasm, is regarded as a safe drug. Despite a preferential action on cerebral vessels, there is clinical and experimental evidence of effects on systemic vascular and intestinal smooth muscle cells. Gastro-intestinal side-effects, however, have not been reported in clinical studies dealing with treatment of vasospasm following subarachnoid haemorrhage. We report on a patient with subarachnoid haemorrhage who developed an acute life-threatening pseudo-obstruction of the colon, a variant of adynamic ileus, while being treated with intravenous nimodipine. The relationship between this complication and calcium antagonist therapy is discussed and therapeutic strategies are presented. We conclude that neurosurgeons and neurologists should be aware of calcium antagonist--related ileus in patients treated with nimodipine.",1990,0
973,2309833,Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus associated with danazol.,"Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus developed in a young woman 8 weeks after the initiation of danazol for treatment of pelvic endometriosis. After discontinuation of danazol the diabetes completely resolved. We suspect a possible cause-and-effect relationship, which has not previously been reported in the literature.",1990,2
974,2316232,Symptomatic hypoglycemia secondary to a glipizide-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole drug interaction.,"Sulfonamides have been reported to augment the hypoglycemic effects of chlorpropamide, glyburide, and tolbutamide. This case report is the first to describe a possible interaction with glipizide. An 83-year-old man receiving glipizide 10 mg bid developed symptomatic hypoglycemia within three days of adding trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) to his regimen. All other factors, including laboratory data, dietary intake, activity level, and concurrent use of other medications, were stable and noncontributory. This patient may have been at increased risk for this interaction secondary to his age and history of alcohol abuse. The mechanism of the interaction is probably inhibition of glipizide metabolism rather than protein-binding displacement. This case suggests that, when TMP/SMX is combined with glipizide, patients should be closely monitored, especially those at high risk for hypoglycemia.",1990,3
975,2320800,Lethal anuria complicating high dose ifosfamide chemotherapy in a breast cancer patient with an impaired renal function.,"A sixty-year-old woman with advanced breast cancer, previously treated with cisplatin, developed an irreversible lethal renal failure with anuria, the day after 5 g/m2 bolus ifosfamide. Postrenal failure was excluded by echography. A prerenal component could have contributed to renal failure because of a transient hypotension, due to an increasing ascitis, occurring just before anuria. However, correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function. Ifosfamide is a known nephrotoxic drug with demonstrated tubulopathies. We strongly suspect that this lethal anuria was mainly due to ifosfamide, occurring in a patient having received previous cisplatin chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient hypotension. We recommend careful use of ifosfamide in patients pretreated with nephrotoxic chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion.",1990,3
976,2327115,Suspected ciprofloxacin-induced interstitial nephritis.,"Interstitial nephritis is a rare but serious adverse effect of many drugs and usually is diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms of hematuria, proteinuria, eosinophilia, fever, azotemia, and rash. Ciprofloxacin is one drug that has been reported to cause interstitial nephritis. Renal toxicities have been reported in less than one percent of the patients receiving ciprofloxacin therapy. Limited documentation of this adverse effect exists in the literature. This article describes a patient with suspected ciprofloxacin-induced interstitial nephritis.",1990,4
977,2329972,Severe acute encephalopathy following inadvertent intrathecal doxorubicin administration.,"In a female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, inadvertent doxorubicin administration intrathecally caused severe, life-threatening, acute encephalopathy with high-pressure hydrocephalus. Ventriculo-peritoneal shunting led to complete reversal of hydrocephalus with progressive disappearance of the acute encephalopathy.",1990,0
978,2332596,Phenobarbital hepatotoxicity in an 8-month-old infant.,"Severe hepatotoxicity from phenobarbital occurred in an infant boy who had a complicated illness with chronic bilateral subdural hematomas and sepsis. Skin rash began after 2 weeks of treatment, and signs of hepatocellular failure developed 3 weeks after phenobarbital had been started. Signs of severe liver disease included elevated aminotransferases, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, significant coagulopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and ascites. Other features of this adverse drug reaction were unremitting fever, leukocytosis with eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytosis, and proteinuria. Sepsis, viral hepatitis, and metabolic liver disease were excluded. The child was on no other medication and had been previously well. In-vitro rechallenge of the patient's lymphocytes with cytochrome P-450 generated metabolites of phenobarbital showed extensive cytotoxicity compared to control. These data support the hypothesis that a defect in drug detoxification was responsible for the child's susceptibility to this drug hepatotoxicity.",1990,3
979,2347102,Atenolol-induced pseudolymphoma.,"The pseudolymphoma syndrome is a reversible reactive condition consisting of fever, lymphadenopathy and generalized rash. Initial cases were associated with anticonvulsants, although other drugs have now been implicated. We report on a case associated with atenolol.",1990,3
980,2357706,Tardive dyskinesia induced by sulpiride.,"Although tardive dyskinesia is a known adverse reaction of sustained treatment with traditional neuroleptic agents, it was only rarely reported in association with sulpiride, a selective D2-receptor antagonist. We describe six patients who developed tardive dyskinesia after treatment with sulpiride for depression or gastrointestinal symptoms. In three patients, involuntary movements emerged during the course of treatment and in the others only after discontinuation of the drug. These cases indicate that sulpiride can cause tardive dyskinesia and that this drug should be administered with caution.",1990,6
981,2369419,Hepatitis with bridging fibrosis and reversible hepatic insufficiency in a woman with rheumatoid arthritis taking methotrexate.,"A patient with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis developed ascites while taking weekly doses of methotrexate (MTX). Her serum transaminase and albumin levels were normal. A liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with bridging fibrosis and piecemeal necrosis. Upon discontinuation of MTX, her ascites resolved, and her arthritis became more active. This is the third report of reversible hepatic decompensation associated with prolonged MTX therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",1990,7
982,2378415,Transtentorial herniation caused by an intracranial mass lesion following high-dose methotrexate.,"A patient with intracranial osteosarcoma that arose 16 years after radiation therapy for hereditary retinoblastoma developed fatal cerebral edema and brainstem herniation after she received a single dose of intravenous methotrexate. Autopsy demonstrated extensive necrosis of the tumor mass, as well as necrotizing vascular damage within the neoplasm. Although high-dose methotrexate has been shown to be useful in the treatment of primary osteogenic sarcoma, the tumoricidal effects of therapy appear to have caused a fatal rise in intracranial pressure.",1990,0
983,2394154,"Fever, pulmonary infiltrates, and pleural effusion following acyclovir therapy for herpes zoster ophthalmicus.","A 71-year-old man presented with herpes zoster ophthalmicus and ocular involvement. Following the institution of intravenous therapy with acyclovir, the patient developed fever, hemoptysis, and a pleural friction rub. A ventilation-perfusion lung scan showed no defects; roentgenograms showed bilateral infiltrates and a left-sided pleural effusion. The fever abated promptly following discontinuation of acyclovir, and radiographic abnormalities resolved over ten days. No other anti-infective therapy was given. To our knowledge, the syndrome of fever, pulmonary infiltrates, and pleural effusion following use of acyclovir has not been previously reported.",1990,9
984,2406680,Quinine-induced hearing loss.,Sensorineural hearing loss due to quinine therapy for malaria has frequently been mentioned in the literature but has not been a subject of research during the last decades. The global spreading of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria brings about an increasing use of quinine. The ototoxicity of quinine can accurately be studied with ultrahigh frequency audiometry (up to 20 kHz). The case of a 29-year-old man suffering from falciparum malaria disease who got a reversible hearing loss from quinine therapy is presented.,1990,0
985,2413037,"Hemolytic uremic syndrome in a patient on cis-platinum, vinblastine and bleomycin.","A 23-year-old woman with metastatic Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor was treated with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin. Hemolytic uremic syndrome appeared, while no evidence of residual tumor was found. Infusion of fresh frozen plasma together with aspirin and dipyridamole resulted in recovery of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Renal insufficiency, however, persisted.",1985,0
986,2417800,Bleomycin pneumonitis potentiated by oxygen administration.,"A case of a 53-year-old man who developed acute pneumonitis after bleomycin and moderate oxygen administration is presented. The patient received bleomycin 189 U over five days for preoperative control of a squamous cell carcinoma of the right tongue and tonsil. Surgery to remove the remaining tumor was performed 19 days later. The highest intraoperative oxygen concentration was 33 percent, but 40 percent oxygen was administered for four days postoperatively. He became febrile and developed a productive cough and pulmonary infiltrates on postoperative day 4. Despite antibiotic therapy, his pulmonary function deteriorated and 100 percent oxygen was required to maintain adequate oxygenation. He sustained a myocardial infarction on postoperative day 7 and progressively deteriorated and expired five days later. Autopsy findings were consistent with bleomycin and oxygen-induced pulmonary damage. Oxygen potentiation of bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity is discussed.",1985,12
987,2429270,Procainamide-induced incessant supraventricular tachycardia in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.,"A patient with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome presented with incessant orthodromic atrioventricular tachycardia following initiation of procainamide therapy. This finding was repeatedly documented both clinically as well as during electrophysiologic testing. Escape atrial complexes, which occurred following junctional premature complexes, failed to initiate tachycardia in the control state but tachycardia was always reinitiated by an identical escape sequence after procainamide. In addition, the tachycardia persisted and was repeatedly spontaneously reinitiated for prolonged periods after procainamide. The pro-arrhythmic effects of procainamide may be explained on the basis of both its vagolytic action on the atrioventricular node as well as by prolongation of refractoriness in the accessory pathway. These observations add to the literature on pro-arrhythmic effects of commonly used antiarrhythmic drugs.",1986,9
988,2442958,Multicentric hepatocellular carcinoma following phosphate diethylstilbestrol therapy for prostatic cancer.,"This paper reports an autopsy case of a 78-year-old male with multiple nodules in the liver developed after long-termed administration of phosphate diethylstilbestrol (PDES) for prostatic cancer. Large part of these nodules were suspected to be well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with high level of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) up to 3,400 ng/ml, but a part of them was evaluated to be a borderline between hepatocellular carcinoma and adenoma with mild cellular atypism. The liver other than the nodules showed liver fibrosis associated with liver cell dysplasia and peliosis hepatis-like change. This is a unique autopsy case of hepatocellular carcinoma closely related to diethylstilbestrol (DES) therapy for prostatic cancer.",1987,5
989,2445709,Peripheral neuropathy and cerebellar syndrome associated with amiodarone therapy.,A 52-year-old woman developed symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy and cerebellar syndrome after 24 months of amiodarone treatment. Sural nerve biopsy revealed mild demyelination and many inclusion bodies in the axoplasm and in Schwann cell cytoplasm. Improvement in her condition was evident 6 months after discontinuing amiodarone.,1987,8
990,2452936,Life-threatening hyponatremia caused by vinblastine.,"Some days after the administration of a third bolus of ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) a patient affected by immunoblastic lymphoma underwent a neurotoxic crisis. The episode lasted 1 week and was followed by a dramatic fall in plasma sodium (104 mEq I-1), associated with a proportionally lesser decrease in plasma chloride and phosphate. Despite the lowest plasma osmolality, detectable levels of circulating ADH were present. After 36 h the hyponatremic episode improved after the infusion of hypertonic sodium chloride. Nevertheless the patient lapsed into a hypotonic coma. The urinary concentrations of the main tubular enzymes (gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, alpha-glucosidase) proved very high and successively decreased slowly. The most likely cause of such hyponatremic episode is vinblastine. The drug acted through: (a) an already known inappropriate release of ADH, and (b) a hitherto unreported tubular lesion, which impaired the reabsorption of sodium and other coupled solutes.",1988,0
991,2461837,Streaky pigmentation in a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).,"We report a case of hyperpigmentation due to bleomycin treatment in a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although this type of hyperpigmentation has been previously seen in patients with cancer who are receiving bleomycin, this is, to our knowledge, the first reported case of bleomycin-induced hyperpigmentation in an AIDS patient and should be added to the growing list of cutaneous eruptions seen in these patients.",1988,11
992,2483959,Renal failure associated with the use of dextran-40.,"A typical case of dextran-40 associated acute renal failure is presented. In this patient a single plasma exchange was successful in considerably lowering the plasma dextran concentration. At the same time the elevated plasma oncotic pressure was reduced to normal values. Diuresis returned within 12 h. Several possible explanations of the mechanism of renal failure associated with the use of dextran-40 are discussed. While the mechanism of dextran-associated renal failure remains unsolved, plasma exchange seems to be effective therapy.",1989,12
993,2505541,MR findings in methotrexate-induced CNS abnormalities.,"MR of the brain was performed in eight patients (mean age, 14.9 years) with osteogenic sarcoma during or after IV treatment with high-dose methotrexate. MR detected brain abnormalities in four patients, three of whom had concomitant neurologic dysfunction. Pathologic findings demonstrated on MR were (1) chronic brain edema, demonstrable over a period of 3-14 months (proved by autopsy in one patient); (2) multifocal white matter necrosis; and (3) deep brain atrophy. MR appears to be valuable in the detection of abnormalities induced by treatment with high-dose methotrexate.",0,0
994,2523364,Morphea after bromocriptine therapy.,"A 57-year-old man developed morphea while taking bromocriptine. This drug is a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid, one of a class of drugs that is associated with fibrotic disorders. Other agents known for such association are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and beta-adrenergic blockers. A common pathogenesis to link these agents to fibrosis remains uncertain.",1989,4
995,2532694,Dapsone-induced erythroderma with Beau's lines.,"A 35-year-old female with borderline lepromatous (BL) leprosy who suffered from dapsone-induced erythroderma is reported. Sudden onset of erythroderma gave rise to a temporary arrest of the function of nail matrix with the resultant Beau's lines. She rapidly recovered with omission of dapsone and therapy with systemic corticosteroids and a topical emollient. In view of the potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction, we suggest that any patient on multidrug therapy for leprosy needs an urgent referral to a dermatologist if the patient develops a skin rash during the first two months of treatment.",1989,12
996,2549018,Fluoxetine-induced akathisia: clinical and theoretical implications.,"Five patients receiving fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder or major depression developed akathisia. The typical fluoxetine-induced symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, purposeless movements of the feet and legs, and marked anxiety were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic-induced akathisia in the past reported that the symptoms of fluoxetine-induced akathisia were identical, although somewhat milder. Akathisia appeared to be a common side effect of fluoxetine and generally responded well to treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, dose reduction, or both. The authors suggest that fluoxetine-induced akathisia may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of fluoxetine-induced akathisia and tricyclic antidepressant-induced ""jitteriness"" may be identical.",1989,9
997,2554727,Horner's syndrome and demyelinating peripheral neuropathy caused by high-dose cytosine arabinoside.,High-dose cytosine arabinoside may benefit patients with refractory acute leukemia. Peripheral nervous system disturbances caused by cytosine arabinoside have rarely been reported. We describe a patient with acute leukemia who developed Horner's syndrome and a severe demyelinating peripheral neuropathy leading to death after receiving high-dose cytosine arabinoside. Peripheral nerve dysfunction is a potentially serious complication of high-dose cytosine arabinoside.,1989,12
998,2568058,Nail-changes induced by penicillamine.,"Peculiar nail-changes in a 70-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis occurring after approximately 1 year of penicillamine treatment are described. After cessation of treatment there was a gradual resolution with regain of normal nails after 7 months. Reinstitution of penicillamine treatment caused a recurrence thus proving a causal relationship between penicillamine and the described nail-changes. The fingernails were more affected than the toenails and clinically the changes consisted of absence of lunulae, longitudinal ridging, transverse or longitudinal defects of the nailplate and a tendency of onychoschizia.",1989,0
999,2586773,Ibuprofen-induced meningitis: detection of intrathecal IgG synthesis and immune complexes.,"We report a case of ibuprofen-induced meningitis in an otherwise healthy individual. This is the 1st case documenting intrathecal IgG synthesis and immune complex formation in this disorder. The immunopathogenesis remains obscure, but is suggestive of an antigen-specific process requiring the presence of or exposure to ibuprofen.",1989,12
1000,2595431,Metoclopramide-induced parkinsonism.,"Metoclopramide hydrochloride (Reglan) is a widely prescribed drug for treatment of upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Although the drug is relatively safe, a growing body of literature has noted movement disorders after its administration. We have reported six cases of metoclopramide-induced parkinsonism seen in consultation over a two-year period. Five of these six patients had renal failure. Their parkinsonism improved on discontinuation of metoclopramide therapy. Metoclopramide-induced parkinsonism is not rare, and appropriate dose reduction in patients with renal failure will help reduce the incidence of this morbidity.",1989,12
1001,2611886,Fatal stroke in migraine: a case report with autopsy findings.,A 50-year-old woman with migraine was admitted to hospital shortly after having abruptly developed hemiparesis. CT scan revealed infarction in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Death ensued after three days due to cerebral edema with herniation. Autopsy revealed no pathologic findings in the heart or in the extra- or intracranial arteries. It is suggested that the fatal stroke may have resulted from arterial spasm caused by ergotamine overdosage and possibly complicated by thrombosis.,1989,12
1002,2616440,Life-threatening acute hyponatraemia induced by low dose cyclophosphamide and indomethacin.,We report the case of a patient with multiple myeloma who developed acute life-threatening water intoxication following treatment with oral indomethacin and low dose intravenous cyclophosphamide. We describe a possible drug interaction between these two drugs and recommend that they should only be used together with caution.,1989,12
1003,2621382,Clofazimine induced nail changes.,"Two cases of lepromatous leprosy with erythema nodosum leprosum who were on high doses of clofazimine, showed discoloration of nail plate, subungual hyperkeratosis and onycholysis. These nail changes gradually disappeared when the dose of clofazimine was reduced.",1989,10
1004,2643458,Attenuation of asparaginase-induced hyperglycemia after substitution of the Erwinia carotovora for the Escherichia coli enzyme preparation.,"L-asparaginase, an enzyme with established antileukemic activity, increases the induction rate and duration of remission of acute lymphoblastic leukemia when added to vincristine and prednisone for induction therapy. Enzymes derived from two different bacterial sources (Escherichia coli and Erwinia carotovora) are in common use. These enzymes may be associated with toxic reactions of differing frequency and severity. Specifically, the complication of enzyme-induced hyperglycemia may be seen more frequently after exposure to the E. coli product. The authors present two patients in whom it was necessary to substitute the Erwinia enzyme for the E. coli enzyme because of the occurrence of severe allergic reactions to the E. coli enzyme. Hyperglycemia induced by the first product improved after the substitution, suggesting that the Erwinia enzyme may be less diabetogenic than the E. coli enzyme.",1989,2
1005,2663536,Development of persistent late onset asthma following treatment with captopril.,We describe the first case of de novo asthma following treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. Despite drug withdrawal there was evidence of persistent airways obstruction and bronchial hyperreactivity. This suggests the possibility that ACE inhibitors may uncover an asthmatic tendency in patients with pre-existing bronchial hyperreactivity.,1989,6
1006,2669373,Thrombotic microangiopathy associated with chemotherapy: case report and review of the literature.,"Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a serious toxicity associated with a small number of antineoplastic agents. A case report of a patient with probable cisplatin and bleomycin-induced TMA is presented. The basic triad of symptoms that occurs in the TMA syndrome include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal impairment. Cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurologic complications also occur frequently. The pathogenesis of chemotherapy-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (C-TMA) has not been established. Proposed mechanisms include von Willebrand Factor abnormalities, decreased prostacyclin production, and immune complex formation. Treatment modalities have been unsuccessful and the majority of patients reported have died. Immunoperfusion with staphylococcal protein A is the most effective treatment available and this new technique appears promising. This article reviews the results of all cases of C-TMA reported to date in the English literature and discusses the theories of pathogenesis, clinical features, treatment, and treatment-related complications of the syndrome.",0,0
1007,267281,Portal hypertension in a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia.,"A patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia treated with busulphan for 4-5 years, developed signs of busulphan toxicity and portal hypertension with ascites, oesophageal varices and jaundice. At post-mortem there was minimal leukaemic infiltration but there were alterations in the liver architecture sufficient to explain the portal hypertension. The pathogenesis of the liver changes and their possible relationship to splenomegaly and busulphan toxicity are considered.",1977,5
1008,2690546,Amiodarone induced torsades de pointe. Report of three cases and review of literature.,"The occurrence of torsades de pointe is often associated with the use of drugs. We report three cases of amiodarone-induced torsades de pointe. Although a lot of amiodarone-induced torsades de pointe have been published, a review of all these cases and the underlying risk-factors has never been made.",1989,0
1009,2717661,The syndrome of irreversible lithium-effectuated neurotoxicity (SILENT).,"Though the acute complications of lithium toxicity involving the central nervous system have been known for more than 70 years, it is only recently that the longlasting sequelae of lithium intoxication have come to be discussed at length; about fifty-five cases have been reported so far. The acronym SILENT (Syndrome of Irreversible Lithium-Effectuated Neurotoxicity) has been coined recently to denote these sequelae. The present report describes the typical profile of SILENT (persisting cerebellar dysfunction) and suggests measures to decrease the incidence of this potentially serious condition, for which no definitive treatment is available.",1989,3
1010,2719905,Long lasting respiratory depression induced by morphine-6-glucuronide?,We report a case of long lasting respiratory depression after intravenous administration of morphine to a 7 year old girl with haemolytic uraemic syndrome. The plasma concentrations of the active metabolite M6G were more than 10 times those normally seen and the half-lives of M6G and morphine were prolonged.,1989,4
1011,2728526,Rifampin-associated thrombocytopenia secondary to poor compliance.,"Rifampin can be associated with severe adverse effects such as hepatitis, acute renal failure, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia has traditionally been associated with intermittent therapy. This article reports the occurrence of rifampin-associated thrombocytopenia in an indigent patient after a four-month lapse in therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient's platelet count dropped rapidly to a level of 1000/mm3 after receiving a single 600 mg dose of rifampin. After returning to a normal level of greater than 100,000/mm3, the patient's platelets again dropped to 1200/mm3 with readministration of rifampin. The long-term therapy necessary to eradicate the Mycobacterium tuberculosis organism makes economic considerations important. This patient and other indigent patients who may be poor compliers because they are unable to buy the necessary medication may be at a higher risk for adverse reactions.",1989,5
1012,2738729,Withdrawal emergent syndrome in an infant associated with maternal haloperidol therapy.,"Withdrawal emergent syndrome (WES) is a subtype of tardive dyskinesia that has been reported in children who were taken off antipsychotic therapy. We present the first case of WES in an infant born to a mother taking haloperidol during her pregnancy. The infant developed repeated tongue thrust, abnormal hand posturing, and tremor of all extremities. Most symptoms resolved within several days, but tongue thrust continued until 6 months of age.",1989,6
1013,2743258,"Secondary acute myelocytic leukemia after adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast carcinoma. A new complication of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil therapy.","The occurrence of treatment-related hematologic malignancies after adjuvant therapy with alkylating agents for gastrointestinal cancers, ovarian carcinoma, and breast cancer and after treatment for Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, germ-cell tumors, and multiple myeloma has been well documented. Adjuvant chemotherapy is frequently used for the treatment of early stage breast cancer, and to date there has been no increase in the incidence of secondary myelodysplastic syndromes or acute leukemia after cyclophosphamide-based regimens when compared with surgical controls. This report describes two patients who developed acute myelocytic leukemia only after exposure to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil adjuvant therapy. These two cases of acute leukemia, which developed 3 years after diagnosis of breast cancer and initiation of chemotherapy, were characterized by trilineage dysplasia and pancytopenia, and had abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 7: characteristics consistent with treatment-related leukemia. Many women are diagnosed with early stage breast cancer each year who are potential candidates for adjuvant therapy. Although certain subgroups of patients have been shown to benefit from adjuvant therapy, continued efforts must be directed at identifying responders so that others will not be exposed to the additional risks of chemotherapy.",1989,8
1014,2746565,Ulcerative proctitis in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus after ibuprofen treatment.,Rare side effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are recognized with increasing frequency. Ibuprofen rarely causes lower gastrointestinal adverse reactions but has been implicated in systemic and local side effects in patients with lupus. We describe a case of ulcerative proctitis after ibuprofen treatment in a girl with juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus.,1989,2
1015,2768785,Reversible treatment-related leukoencephalopathy.,"We present two children with acute lymphocytic leukemia who developed leukoencephalopathy following administration of a combination of intravenous ara = C and methotrexate during the consolidation phase of chemotherapy. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed widespread, abnormally high signal intensity in the deep white matter in both patients, though one patient had normal cranial computed tomographic scan. Treatment was modified, symptoms resolved in 1 to 2 weeks, and the white-matter changes resolved over 6 to 12 months. Intravenous cytarabine and methotrexate appear to act synergistically to enhance the potential for central nervous system toxicity. Awareness of this potentially serious complication of chemotherapy can facilitate timely recognition of leukoencephalopathy with the use of magnetic resonance imaging.",1989,7
1016,2781955,Dexamethasone treatment of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) with or without persistent administration of the drug.,"Treatment of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) with thionamide, lithium or radioactive iodine is ineffective. This particular form of hyperthyroidism is long-lasting because of the slow elimination of amiodarone. Therefore, an alternative therapy is necessary, especially for patients who need to continue permanent administration of the drug. We report 2 cases of AIT: in one case, amiodarone was interrupted; in the other case, amiodarone was continued because of recurrent ventricular tachycardia resistant to classical antiarrhythmic drugs. Both patients were successfully treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) and dexamethasone (DXT).",1989,0
1017,278642,Acute myelogenous leukemia in patients receiving chlorambucil as long-term adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II breast cancer.,"Thirteen consecutive stage II breast cancer patients were treated with long-term adjuvant chemotherapy using chlorambucil. At least three of these patients developed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). All three patients (and possibly a fourth) who developed AML were postmenopausal, received continuous chlorambucil for greater than or equal to 4 years, had acute red cell anemia at the time of treatment, and had a wbc count in the range of 2700-7700/mm3. After the chlorambucil was discontinued, the wbc count began to slowly rise and the patient developed clinical AML. In all three patients, the diagnosis of AML was established by pathologists on the basis of bone marrow biopsy, aspirate, and peripheral smears. Each of these was subsequently reviewed by the hematologist who treated the patients for AML. Patients who have breast cancer (or any other solid tumor malignancy) are at risk to develop a second malignancy. However, an increasing number of reports are appearing suggesting more than just a casual relationship between leukemia and the use of alkylating agents. This may be related to the dose and duration of therapy with these agents.",1978,8
1018,2796025,Panic anxiety after abrupt discontinuation of mianserin.,"We observed a case of withdrawal after abrupt discontinuation of mianserin. A 41-year-old woman was treated according to a diagnosis of depression, which was her 6th episode. Mianserin 30 mg/day, etizolam 1 mg/day and flunitrazepam 1 mg/day were administered. When the patient discontinued taking the drugs by herself because of subsiding of these symptoms, severe panic anxiety appeared. This panic anxiety was not relieved by taking etizolam and flunitrazepam again, but subsided rapidly by the re-administration of mianserin 30 mg/day, and because of that the depressive symptom also disappeared. From these experiences panic anxiety seemed to be a withdrawal symptom, and involvement of the noradrenergic system in panic anxiety as well as serotonergic system was suggested.",1989,6
1019,2803154,Prior neurologic illness and the syndrome of irreversible lithium-effectuated neurotoxicity (SILENT).,Prior neurologic illness or CNS insult of any kind is known to increase the vulnerability to neurotoxicity of lithium. In this event the occurrence of neurotoxicity does not correlate with serum lithium levels. The authors describe a patient with hemiparesis who developed the syndrome of irreversible lithium-effectuated neurotoxicity (SILENT) while being treated with lithium for a manic episode. The authors review the literature on this aspect and highlight the dangers of starting lithium treatment in patients with neurologic impairment.,1989,9
1020,2811895,Life-threatening cranial dystonia following trihexyphenidyl withdrawal.,"A 64-year-old woman with blepharospasm, sustained clenching of the jaw, antecollis, and a strained, high-pitched phonation continued chronic trihexyphenidyl therapy despite the lack of any obvious benefit. Abrupt, accidental withdrawal of trihexyphenidyl triggered severe exacerbation of the cranial dystonia associated with inspiratory stridor and acute respiratory difficulties, prompting emergency admission. On indirect laryngoscopy, hyperadduction of the vocal folds was not the cause of the upper airway obstruction. A more likely cause of the inspiratory obstruction appeared to be forward bending of the neck combined with mouth-clenching spasms. Reinstitution of intravenous anticholinergic medication provided relatively prompt relief. We caution against abrupt interruption of anticholinergics in patients with severe segmental cranial dystonia, even in those cases in which no benefit is apparent to observers.",1989,0
1021,2816647,MR findings in methotrexate-induced CNS abnormalities.,"MR of the brain was performed in eight patients (mean age, 14.9 years) with osteogenic sarcoma during or after IV treatment with high-dose methotrexate. MR detected brain abnormalities in four patients, three of whom had concomitant neurologic dysfunction. Pathologic findings demonstrated on MR were (1) chronic brain edema, demonstrable over a period of 3-14 months (proved by autopsy in one patient); (2) multifocal white matter necrosis; and (3) deep brain atrophy. MR appears to be valuable in the detection of abnormalities induced by treatment with high-dose methotrexate.",1989,12
1022,282937,Paraplegia following intrathecal cytosine arabinoside.,"Paraplegia following prophylactic intrathecal cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) is described in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia in remission who received doses of 100 mg/m2/d for 5 consecutive days. Cerebrospinal fluid examination prior to the last dosage of cytosine arabinoside revealed a mononuclear pleocytosis and increased protein. The neurological manifestations developed within one week after the last dose of Ara-C and persisted for over 8 weeks. Administration of intrathecal Ara-C in the same dose over longer intervals within 3-5 days between consecutive doses resulted in mild, transient neurological symptoms (paresthesias) in only one of 30 patients so treated.",1979,1
1023,2830062,"The effect of o,p'-DDD on adrenal steroid replacement therapy requirements.","Two patients with adrenal carcinoma treated with 2,2-bis (2-chlorophenyl-4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane (o,p'-DDD) as adjuvant therapy were studied. Both patients developed hypoadrenalism while on o,p'-DDD and apparently adequate dexamethasone replacement therapy. The hypoadrenalism was overcome by increasing steroid replacement therapy. Dexamethasone levels were measured in the serum by radioimmunoassay and shown to be lowered by o,p'-DDD therapy. A study of the absorption and disappearance of dexamethasone from the circulation in response to a (1 mg oral dose indicated that the steroid was absorbed normally but was cleared more rapidly from the circulation of these two patients than from normal controls. This may be due to a change in the type of metabolites excreted. It is suggested that many of the reported side-effects of o,p'-DDD may be due to hypoadrenalism and may be controlled by greatly increasing the steroid replacement dose. The adequacy of corticosteroid replacement therapy may best be assessed by monitoring the levels of ACTH.",1987,10
1024,2857534,Alprazolam-induced mania: two clinical cases.,Two patients treated with alprazolam had histories suggestive of a bipolar disorder and developed lithium-responsive manic episodes. The authors caution that treatment with alprazolam may be complicated by the induction of mania.,1985,3
1025,2862137,Alprazolam withdrawal delirium unresponsive to diazepam: case report.,A case is presented in which a 68-year-old man became delirious after being withdrawn from a low dosage of alprazolam. The delirium was not affected by administration of alprazolam. The authors suggest that alprazolam may have enhanced specificity for a subpopulation of benzodiazepine receptors.,1985,8
1026,2863342,Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis complicating inflammatory bowel disease of childhood.,Sulfasalazine has been associated with bronchopulmonary complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in adults. We describe a 12-year-old boy who developed desquamative interstitial pneumonitis and hepatic cirrhosis several years following the onset of ulcerative colitis. The restrictive lung disease progressed despite cessation of sulfasalazine and initiation of corticosteroid therapy. We discuss a variety of bronchopulmonary complications of IBD and their association with sulfasalazine.,1985,8
1027,2875665,Exacerbation of schizophrenia associated with amantadine.,"Administration of amantadine was associated with psychotic decompensations in two schizophrenic patients being maintained on concomitant neuroleptic medication. Despite a postulated dopaminergic mechanism, there seems to have been only one previous report of amantadine's precipitating psychosis in a schizophrenic patient.",1986,9
1028,2887555,Extrapyramidal side effects: a historical perspective.,"A historical review of the adverse reactions to neuroleptic agents--extrapyramidal side effects--is presented. Soon after its introduction in 1952, chlorpromazine was noted to induce symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease. At first, these symptoms were thought to be related to the drug's antipsychotic effect. Later, more careful research showed that they are not directly associated with the antipsychotic activity of neuroleptic agents. More recently, extrapyramidal side effects have gained importance because they are significant factors in both the patient's acceptance of the particular drug and his or her social adjustment.",1987,9
1029,2894766,Sulfasalazine-induced lupus erythematosus.,"Pneumonitis, bilateral pleural effusions, echocardiographic evidence of cardiac tamponade, and positive autoantibodies developed in a 43-year-old man, who was receiving long-term sulfasalazine therapy for chronic ulcerative colitis. After cessation of the sulfasalazine and completion of a six-week course of corticosteroids, these problems resolved over a period of four to six months. It is suggested that the patient had sulfasalazine-induced lupus, which manifested with serositis and pulmonary parenchymal involvement in the absence of joint symptoms. Physicians who use sulfasalazine to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease should be aware of the signs of sulfasalazine-induced lupus syndrome.",1988,3
1030,2924444,Acute myocardial infarction due to coronary spasm associated with L-thyroxine therapy.,"A 63-year-old man with hypothyroidism is described. He had been receiving L-thyroxine therapy following mitral valve surgery. About three weeks into the therapy regimen, he complained of severe retrosternal chest oppression. Electrocardiographic findings and laboratory data indicated a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction due to the L-thyroxine therapy. Emergency selective coronary angiography was performed. Comparing his coronary angiograms with those obtained before surgery indicated a severely spastic left coronary artery. We believe this is the first report of myocardial infarction due to coronary spasm, demonstrated by angiography associated with L-thyroxine therapy.",1989,3
1031,2931445,L-Thyroxine-induced leukopenia in a patient with Hashimoto's disease: involvement of suppressor-cytotoxic T cells.,"A study of in vitro reactivity to L-T4, as assessed by peripheral blood lymphocyte transformation, was carried out in a patient with Hashimoto's disease who developed leukopenia during treatment with L-T4. L-T4 stimulated lymphocyte transformation in this patient. The proliferating cells were of T lineage and further typing demonstrated that they bore the OKT8 antigen. Cell-mediated immune reactions mediated by OKT8+T cells might have caused the leukopenia, although other mechanisms involving cytotoxic antibodies or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity cannot be excluded.",1985,11
1032,2935070,Ampicillin-induced interstitial nephritis with generalised exfoliative dermatitis.,"Drug induced renal failure is a serious, potentially, fatal illness that is preventable. Hypersensitivity reactions involving the kidneys can occur with any of the penicillin groups. However, there are few reports in the literature of ampicillin as a cause of acute interstitial nephritis. In the following case report, a patient developed acute interstitial nephritis with renal failure and exfoliative dermatitis following ampicillin therapy. The diagnosis was based on the rapid onset of renal failure, presence of eosinophilia, skin rash, and characteristic renal biopsy finding, following the administration of ampicillin. Renal function returned to normal eventually, but she continued to have relapses of exfoliative dermatitis up to a year later.",1985,10
1033,2937155,Vancomycin-induced vasculitis.,"A patient receiving vancomycin for a serious staphylococcal infection had a lupus-like syndrome characterized by a malar rash, pain and erythema of the cartilage of both ears, and tender erythematous and hemorrhagic lesions of the finger tips. Biopsy and direct immunofluorescence study of the skin showed changes consistent with the diagnosis of lupus erythematosus. The possible development of a drug-induced vasculitis or lupus-like syndrome should be added to the list of rare toxic effects of vancomycin.",1986,3
1034,2940999,Abnormal retinal function associated with isotretinoin therapy for acne.,"Three of 50 patients treated with isotretinoin (1 mg/kg/day) for cystic acne complained of poor night vision and/or excessive glare sensitivity. While still receiving the drug or shortly thereafter, two patients were found to have abnormal dark-adaptation curves, with elevations of either cone or rod thresholds, or both. Two patients had abnormal electroretinograms (ERGs). One had a mildly abnormal electro-oculogram. The dark-adaptation curves were normal for one patient several months after isotretinoin therapy was discontinued. Two patients had elevated cone thresholds at least one year later. Six months following cessation of therapy, the ERG was still abnormal for one patient, but continued improvement was evident at 25 months; for the second patient, the ERG was normal at one year. Analysis of Naka-Rushton parameters for the ERG scotopic b-wave stimulus-response curves indicated response compression for two patients, as evidenced by a reduction in the maximum response. For one patient, the half-saturation constant was elevated 0.7 log units, suggesting reduction of retinal sensitivity, perhaps from decrease in retinal photopigment concentration. We suspect that isotretinoin may complete for normal retinol binding sites on cell surfaces or transport molecules. A prospective study is currently underway to determine if a clinically measurable adverse effect on retinal function is seen with greater frequency.",1986,6
1035,2943526,Neurologic toxicity associated with hepatic artery infusion HAI of FUdR.,"A 66-year-old man with hepatic metastases from gastric adenocarcinoma was treated on two occasions with 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (FUdR) via hepatic artery infusion (HAI). The patient developed neurologic signs and symptoms including disorientation, oculomotor defects, ataxia and multifocal myoclonus during both attempts at HAI. Systemic drug toxicity is unusual when FUdR is given via HAI, and neurologic toxicity has not previously been reported. We postulate individual hypersensitivity to FUdR or selective concentration of FUdR in brainstem structures to explain the toxicity in this case.",1986,0
1036,2956288,Optic neuropathy in ethambutol-treated renal tuberculosis.,"Ethambutol is frequently used in the treatment of tuberculosis, and, although optic neuropathies have been reported with the use of ethambutol, this adverse side effect has been considered to be rare and generally reversible with discontinuation of the medication. However, we recently saw two patients with renal tuberculosis treated with ethambutol in whom visual loss from toxic optic neuropathies was severe and irreversible despite careful ophthalmological monitoring and prompt discontinuation of the agent at the first sign of impaired visual function. While ethambutol treatment is most commonly instituted for pulmonary tuberculosis, it is interesting to note that both of these patients had renal tuberculosis. Since ethambutol is actively excreted via the renal system, compromise of renal function such as due to renal tuberculosis may lead to serum concentration elevations of ethambutol sufficient to produce optic neuropathy.",1987,6
1037,2979256,Gastro-oesophageal reflux associated with nifedipine.,"A 57-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of dysphagia for solids, 6 months after starting treatment with nifedipine. Endoscopy demonstrated oesophagitis and a benign oesophageal stricture. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory pH monitoring demonstrated decreased acid reflux 8 weeks after withdrawal of nifedipine, with coincidental symptomatic and endoscopic improvement. Nifedipine may induce, or aggravate, pre-existing, gastro-oesophageal reflux.",1988,8
1038,3003260,Cataracts induced by intermittent Decadron used as an antiemetic.,"Recent reports have shown that Decadron (dexamethasone; Merck Sharp & Dohme, West Point, Pa) has a significant antiemetic effect on cisplatin-induced vomiting. Although the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts is a known complication of systemic steroid therapy, it usually occurs after several years of chronic administration. A young diamond dealer developed visual impairment attributed to bilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts following only four courses of intermittent Decadron used as part of a five-drug antiemetic regimen for cisplatin-associated nausea. This report is intended to alert others to the possible development of this serious complication following short-term Decadron therapy.",1986,2
1039,3030084,Transient phenytoin induced IgA deficiency and permanent IgE increase.,"This is a report of a 9-year-old epileptic boy, who was studied over a period of 7 years. The seizures started when he was 2 months old. He was treated with phenytoin from the age of 2 years and 7 months. Serum and salivary IgA were absent with high IgE serum total. The routine immunologic studies were normal. The IgA was normalized after phenytoin withdrawal, but IgE determination increased progressively without any atopic symptoms. The T4 (helper)/T8 (suppressor) ratio decreased (1.0 and 1.2) on two different days, although above the normal limit. The phenytoin only modified the IgA levels. These data suggest that a primary immunoregulatory abnormality may be present in drug induced IgA deficiency.",0,0
1040,3059159,Overdose with chloral hydrate: a pharmacological and therapeutic review.,"The purpose of this review is to highlight the toxicity of chloral hydrate and to review the management of overdoses with chloral hydrate. Three patients are presented in whom life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias dominated the clinical presentation. These arrhythmias were resistant to standard antiarrhythmic therapy. Also, we have reviewed selected features in eight patients who took overdoses of chloral hydrate who were admitted to an intensive care unit between 1981 and 1988. The pharmacology and toxicology of chloral hydrate are discussed with particular reference to the cardiac arrhythmias that are seen with overdosage. A proposed management scheme is detailed, including intravenously-administered propranolol as the preferred first-line antiarrhythmic agent. A case may be made for the discontinuation of the usage of chloral hydrate.",0,0
1041,3067748,Adrenaline dacryolith: detection by ultrasound examination of the nasolacrimal duct.,"A 73-year-old woman on topical pilocarpine and adrenaline for chronic simple glaucoma for three years presented with a mass in the medial canthus of the right eye. Although dacryocystography showed a dilated and partially obstructed nasolacrimal system, ultrasound examination was able to demonstrate a mass in the nasolacrimal duct. At operation a black dacryolith was found, of the diameter predicted by ultrasound. Histological examination of the dacryolith suggested its derivation from breakdown products of adrenaline.",1988,12
1042,3084231,Reversible valproic acid-induced dementia: a case report.,"Reversible valproic acid-induced dementia was documented in a 21-year-old man with epilepsy who had a 3-year history of insidious progressive decline in global cognitive abilities documented by serial neuropsychological studies. Repeat neuropsychological testing 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug revealed dramatic improvement in IQ, memory, naming, and other tasks commensurate with clinical recovery in his intellectual capacity. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms which may have been operative in this case include: a direct central nervous system (CNS) toxic effect of valproic acid; a paradoxical epileptogenic effect secondary to the drug; and an indirect CNS toxic effect mediated through valproic acid-induced hyperammonemia.",0,0

1044,3115809,Isoniazid and ethambutol as a cause of optic neuropathy.,"A well-recognized complication of ethambutol use is optic neuropathy, but the potential ocular toxicity of isoniazid is often overlooked. A patient developed optic neuropathy while being treated with isoniazid and ethambutol. The optic neuropathy subsided only when both drugs were discontinued, suggesting an additive toxic effect.",1987,7
1045,3124393,Calcification and ossification of the spinal arachnoid after intrathecal administration of Depo-Medrol.,"A woman 38-year-old, suffering for about ten years from multiple sclerosis and treated with repeated therapy cycles of intrathecal Depo-Medrol, developed a spastic paraparesis at the lower limbs. A lumbar myelography was carried out, and a dorsal block was demonstrated. The patient underwent a dorsal laminectomy, and arachnoidal calcification and ossification was find, but the removal of the bone plaques was ineffectual in order to the subsequent course of the neurological troubles. The results of the histological study and chemical tests are reported, and the etiology and the pathogenesis are discussed on the basis of the pertinent literature.",1987,0
1046,3128415,An interaction between cytostatic and anticonvulsant drugs.,"A young woman with epilepsy had tonic-clonic seizures during antineoplastic therapy with adriamycin and cisplatin. During two courses of cytostatic drug administration peak and trough plasma levels of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate sodium were measured. Lower plasma levels of carbamazepine and valproate sodium were observed after 2 days of antineoplastic therapy. Normal plasma levels of these drugs were found 2 to 3 days after the last cisplatin dose. Impaired absorption or accelerated elimination might explain these results. Phenytoin levels were reduced to 37% of the original values, although the drug was given intravenously. Changed Michaelis-Menten parameters suggest that cisplatin increases the metabolic rate of phenytoin. Another explanation for the decreased drug levels might be an increased volume of distribution. Calculation of this volume from peak and trough levels showed an increase of the volume of distribution during and after chemotherapy.",1988,4
1047,3136101,Hyperkalemia as a late side effect of prolonged adrenocorticotropic hormone therapy for infantile spasms.,Two infants developed hyperkalemia shortly after cessation of prolonged ACTH therapy for infantile spasms.

1048,3143551,"Camptocormia, a new side effect of sodium valproate.","A mentally retarded 23-year-old woman with myoclonic astatic epilepsy developed an abnormal posture of extreme forward flexion, called camptocormia, during valproate monotherapy. Camptocormia occurred concomitantly with an increase of the plasma valproate level from about 330 mumol/l up to 530 mumol/l. Four weeks earlier she had developed hepatopathy during a regimen of carbamazepine, lynestrenol and sodium valproate. Hepatopathy subsided after the cessation of carbamazepine and lynestrenol. Camptocormia improved within a week after the reduction of the plasma valproate level to about 300 mumol/l. Four months later reversible camptocormia was manifested again concomitantly with about the same plasma valproate levels as above. Accordingly, camptocormia is a dose-dependent side effect of valproate.",1987,7

1050,3152997,Atrial fibrillation following methylprednisolone pulse therapy.,"Two children, one with renal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus and the other with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, were treated with methylprednisolone pulses. Neither had previous evidence of underlying cardiac disease. Within 24 h of pulse therapy, they complained of palpitations and developed atrial fibrillation which reversed spontaneously or after anti-arrhythmic therapy. Subsequent serial electro- and echocardiograms were normal. We propose that the arrhythmias were a complication of steroid pulse therapy.",1988,1

We report an additional case of isotretinoin teratogenicity in which the patient had agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, multiple leptomeningeal neuroglial heterotopias, hydrocephalus, and abnormalities of the corticospinal tracts. These findings are related to those reported previously.",1985,0
1052,3159106,Allopurinol hypersensitivity. A case report.,"The allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome is a rare adverse drug reaction. It usually occurs in patients with impaired renal function or when allopurinol is prescribed with a thiazide diuretic. The recognition of the characteristic features of the syndrome is vital since early aggressive therapy is indicated. A case of allopurinol hypersensitivity, possibly the first in a black African, is reported.",1985,6
1053,3166573,Bone formation induced in an infant by systemic prostaglandin-E2 administration.,"We report a case of long-term systemic administration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to a newborn infant with ductus-dependent congenital heart disease. After 46 days of treatment, radiography showed cortical hyperostosis of the long bones. The child died 62 days after discontinuation of prostaglandin treatment. Histologic examination of tubular bones showed hyperostosis presumably due to prostaglandin-induced rapid formation of primitive bone. The additional finding of extensive resorption of the outer cortical surface and bone formation at the inner surface suggested a reversible phase after discontinuation of treatment.",1988,8
1054,3171334,Severe visual loss after a single dose of vincristine in a patient with spinal cord astrocytoma.,"A case of severe visual loss following a single dose of vincristine is described. The primary pathology was a spinal cord astrocytoma, grade II, with no intracranial extension. Visual loss after a single small dose of vincristine has never been reported. While peripheral neuropathy and cranial nerve involvement is common, optic neuropathy is extremely rare. The literature of vincristine optic nerve toxicity is reviewed. Although differential diagnostic alternatives can be considered in all described cases it is very likely that vincristine does cause severe visual loss in a small number of patients.",1988,0
1055,3174043,Niacin maculopathy.,"Three patients with niacin-induced visual symptoms had cystoid maculopathy without leakage on fluorescein angiography, and a fourth patient with no fundus abnormality experienced cessation of visual symptoms upon discontinuation of niacin. All four patients had been taking high doses of niacin (3.0-4.5 g daily) before the onset of symptoms. An additional 15 asymptomatic patients who were receiving high doses of oral niacin (1.0-6.0 g daily) for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia were evaluated for evidence of subclinical macular disease. None of these patients had cystic or other significant macular changes. Niacin causes a reversible toxic cystoid maculopathy that occurs in approximately 0.67% of patients taking high doses of the drug. The authors conclude that among patients taking high doses of oral niacin only those who experience visual symptoms need to be ophthalmologically evaluated.",1988,7

1057,3200786,Rifampicin-induced adrenal insufficiency in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: difficulties in diagnosis and treatment.,"Rifampicin, an antituberculous drug, causes increased hepatic metabolism of steroid hormones. We report the case of a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome treated with rifampicin who had a 'normal' screening test for adrenal insufficiency, yet had clinical evidence of adrenal failure. Diagnostic testing could not be completed due to lack of clinical response to dexamethasone. Both of these findings are due to the unique effects of rifampicin on steroid metabolism.",1988,5

Renal hypophosphatemia in this patient was caused by the erroneous intake of 1 g doxycycline. It is likely that the selective nephrotoxicity in these 3 patients with SIADH was induced by tetracycline.",1988,0

1063,3301251,Hepatotoxicity associated with choline magnesium trisalicylate: case report and review of salicylate-induced hepatotoxicity.,"A case of a 21-year-old woman who had developed mild hepatotoxicity while receiving choline magnesium trisalicylate therapy is described. She presented with fever and mild hepatic enzyme elevations before salicylate therapy was instituted. Liver function tests (LFT) returned to normal within five days of hospitalization but she continued to develop daily fevers. Blood, urine, and throat cultures were negative. An acute viral illness or reactivation of systemic lupus erythematosus were the suspected diagnoses. Choline magnesium trisalicylate was then administered in an effort to control her fever, and was successful. After three days of salicylate therapy her LFT values began to rise. They continued to rise for five more days before salicylate hepatotoxicity was suspected. Choline magnesium trisalicylate was discontinued after eight days and the patient's LFT quickly returned to normal. The source of fever was never identified, although infection with cytomegalovirus was considered the most likely cause. Salicylate-induced hepatotoxicity is reviewed.",0,0
1064,3310776,Captopril-related (and -induced?) asthma.,"A 51-yr-old nonsmoking male patient without any history of previous allergies, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria developed attacks of asthma when captopril was added to the nadolol and dyazide treatment for his high blood pressure. A double-blind challenge with nadolol and captopril decreased FEV1 by 3 and 12%, respectively. This confirmed the history of captopril-related asthma. As angiotensin-converting enzyme seems to play a role in the genesis and metabolism of bronchomotor mediators, this rare form of drug-induced asthma is important for both clinicians and airways pharmacologists.",1987,10
1065,3318771,Drug-induced pemphigoid. A spectrum of diseases.,"Drug-induced ocular pemphigoid has been reported to occur after long-term use of topical glaucoma medications. We have reviewed the literature on drug-induced ocular pemphigoid and have added our experience with five patients with glaucoma who developed ocular cicatricial (benign mucosal) pemphigoid after treatment with various topical glaucoma medications. We also describe a case of timolol-induced ocular pemphigoid. The presentation and progression of drug-induced ocular cicatricial pemphigoid can be variable. We propose that drug-induced ocular pemphigoid represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from a self-limiting, toxic form to a progressive, immunologic form.",1987,12
1066,331881,Deposits of plasma proteins in the skin during treatment with carbamazepine and diphenylhydantoin.,"Biopsies from skin of normal appearance from 18 patients treated with carbamazepine and diphenylhydantoin were investigated by a direct immunofluorescence technique. Seventeen had deposits of plasma proteins at the dermoepidermal junction, 16 had deposits in the vessel walls, and one had autofluorescence of the nuclei in the epidermis and vessel walls. These findings did not correlate with changes in serum IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, IgE or alpha 2-macroglobulin. Eight patients had elevated alkaline phosphatase, 4 elevated IgG and one elevated IgA. Three had low values of IgA, and all had normal values of IgM, IgD and IgE, and blood cells. In three patients, carbamazepine was withdrawn, whereupon the deposits disappeared in two and decreased in the third, who changed to another drug. The changes were quantitatively and qualitatively similar to those seen in systemic lupud erythematosus induced by these drugs.",1977,0
1067,3335488,Desipramine and testicular swelling in two patients.,Two patients are described who developed testicular swelling and pain during treatment with desipramine. The symptoms disappeared when desipramine was discontinued and in one case returned when desipramine treatment was reinitiated. The observations suggest that testicular swelling and pain are side effects of desipramine.,1988,1
1068,3343188,Methemoglobinemia associated with dermal application of benzocaine cream in a cat.,"Benzocaine, an ester-type local anesthetic, was believed responsible for apparent methemoglobinemia in a cat. The cat was admitted with acute respiratory distress, vomiting, and collapse, which began 15 to 20 minutes after topical application of the drug. Treatment consisted of supportive therapy and intravenous administration of methylene blue. The respiratory rate improved within 5 to 10 minutes of methylene blue administration and continued over a period of 2 hours. Benzocaine-induced methemoglobinemia has been reported in man, dogs, and cats. This report supports the findings of others regarding the potential toxicity of topical ester-type local anesthetics.",1988,1
1069,3346128,Erosion of psoriatic plaques after chronic methotrexate administration.,A 43-year-old white man developed a shallow erosion of a psoriatic plaque after chronic administration of methotrexate. This unusual cutaneous sign may be the first sign of methotrexate toxicity.,0,0
1070,3359700,Unexpected severe reversible cyclosporine A-induced nephrotoxicity in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and tubulointerstitial renal disease.,"We describe a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and impaired renal function probably mainly due to tubulointerstitial disease. After a six-week course of low-dose cyclosporine A, she developed a severe but reversible loss of glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow despite of low cyclosporine A plasma levels. Based upon the observed fall of the filtration fraction, the rise in the relative clearance of 99Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid and the increase in proteinuria, we suggest that in this case the tubules and/or interstitium are the main targets for cyclosporine A nephrotoxicity. Neither our patient's clinical symptoms nor her serologic parameters improved possibly because of the low dosage and/or short duration of cyclosporine A treatment. We conclude that one should be cautious when treating patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and pre-existing renal disease with cyclosporine A especially when tubulointerstitial abnormalities are present and/or other nephrotoxic drugs are used.",1988,2
1071,3365032,Polymyositis after propylthiouracil treatment for hyperthyroidism.,"An additional disorder in the spectrum of thyroid related muscle disease is presented. Hypothyroid and hyperthyroid disease are both associated with a variety of muscle abnormalities, from myalgias to myopathy. Polymyositis, however, has never been reported immediately after treatment for active hyperthyroidism. A patient is presented with typical hyperthyroidism, who developed a severe proximal muscle weakness and a raised creatine phosphokinase after treatment for hyperthyroidism with propylthiouracil (100 mg orally, three times a day). Electromyography, muscle biopsy, and the course of the patient's illness were consistent with polymyositis. Whether this represents a cause-effect association or a chance occurrence is unknown. Physician awareness of the occurrence of a variety of muscle disorders including polymyositis in thyroid disease is emphasised. A brief discussion of thyroid myopathy, thionamide drug reactions, and polymyositis is included.",1988,4
1072,3370103,Cardiopulmonary arrest following intravenous phenytoin loading.,"Two patients, aged 44 and 68 years, presented with generalized seizures either witnessed or highly suspected. Both patients had laboratory-proven subtherapeutic anticonvulsant serum levels. The patients differed with regard to risk; one patient had existing cardiopulmonary disease, and the other was free of such risk factors except liver disease. An apparently appropriate dose of intravenous phenytoin was initiated in each case, and the patients were monitored appropriately and given supplemental oxygen. Bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress, and, ultimately, cardiopulmonary arrest occurred in both. The criteria proposed by Earnest et al. should be implemented for each seizure case that requires a decision on the urgent need for therapeutic anticonvulsant levels, whether by mechanical infusion, manual intravenous push, or oral loading. The mechanical infusion is the easiest method to standardize and monitor. The manual intravenous push has a greater possibility of inadvertent overdosage during some small time frame, as well as more local symptoms by some reports. Record et al. have recommended oral loading in selected patients. Careful consideration must be made of the choice of environment in which intravenous loading is done (e.g., emergency department, intensive care unit), as dictated by patient parameters, nursing staff levels, and planned disposition. The crucial factors contributing to the deterioration of both patients in the two cases presented were the concentration of phenytoin manually infused and the possibility that their high-risk status made them poor candidates for manual intravenous phenytoin. Dose and a hypersensitivity reaction were doubtful factors in these cases.",1988,5
1073,3379435,"Reye-like syndrome following treatment with the pantothenic acid antagonist, calcium hopantenate.","Three senile patients developed fatal acute encephalopathy while receiving calcium hopantenate. The clinical, biochemical, and pathological picture was similar to Reye's syndrome. Calcium hopantenate is a pantothenic acid antagonist. The serum levels of calcium hopantenate were high in coma, and that of pantothenic acid examined in one patient was lowered. Evidence obtained indicated that the Reye-like syndrome might be caused by calcium hopantenate possibly due to the induction of pantothenic acid deficiency.",1988,4
1074,3391110,Dyspnea possibly associated with controlled-release morphine sulfate tablets.,"Morphine sulfate in controlled-release tablet form is a relatively new oral preparation being used for the relief of chronic severe pain, such as that related to cancer.

1078,3410226,Development of porphyria cutanea tarda after treatment with cyclophosphamide.,"Porphyria cutanea tarda, a metabolic disorder of heme biosynthesis, is characterized by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, facial hypertrichosis, dark urine, and a distinctive pattern of excess porphyrin production. Hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity is markedly reduced in patients with this disorder. Although porphyria cutanea tarda may be familial, it is more often sporadic in occurrence, and has been associated with excess alcohol ingestion, estrogen administration, iron overload, and several environmental hepatotoxins. It has also been associated on occasion with malignancy. We report a 46-yr-old woman with ovarian carcinoma who developed porphyria cutanea tarda while undergoing treatment with cisplatin and cyclophosphamide. The temporal course of the porphyrin abnormality suggested that cyclophosphamide was the pathogenic agent, and symptoms regressed after cessation of this drug with continued administration of cisplatin. The pathogenesis of the porphyria is not clear; however, cyclophosphamide is a substrate for cytochrome P450, and may produce metabolites that destroy this protein. The resulting increased turnover of heme might then result in overproduction of porphyrin precursors, resulting in the clinical syndrome. Studies of porphyrin metabolism in patients treated with cyclophosphamide may help to elucidate this possibility.",1988,10
1079,3417739,Acute renal failure in a patient treated by continuous povidone-iodine mediastinal irrigation.,"Polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine (PI) is a widely used antiseptic agent, safe and effective, in the treatment and prophylaxis of wound sepsis. By continuous irrigation it is frequently used to treat suppurative mediastinitis after median sternotomy. We describe a 63 year old woman with a suppurative mediastinitis, treated with continuous PI irrigation who developed an acute oliguric renal failure. The withdrawal of PI was followed by a complete improvement of renal function. Herein we present our case and a review of the literature about the systemic toxicity of PI.",0,0

Renal failure necessitated 5 hemodialysis sessions. D-penicillamine was withdrawn and glucocorticoids combined with azathioprine were given with good recovery of renal function. The 9 other reported cases of D-penicillamine induced rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis have been reviewed. This syndrome is potentially life-threatening: the 5 untreated patients died, whereas 5 patients given immunosuppressive therapy are alive.",1987,10
1081,3438585,Gold-induced pneumonitis.,"Gold-induced pneumonitis is a rare complication of gold salt therapy. We describe a patient with rheumatoid arthritis treated with gold salts, who developed bilateral interstitial pulmonary abnormalities and showed a dramatic response on corticosteroid therapy. Although after 4 weeks of treatment with corticosteroids the chest X-ray and lung function were still abnormal, bronchoalveolar lavage showed a normal cell distribution. Corticosteroid therapy was continued for 8 months since there was still improvement of pulmonary function studies. This case supports the view that in gold-induced pneumonitis a prolonged treatment with corticosteroids may be necessary, as lung function continued to improve.",1987,0
1082,3449312,Gold-induced aplastic anemia.,"Three patients receiving gold salt treatment for rheumatoid arthritis developed severe aplastic anemia. All three patients experienced remission of their disease at the time of the occurrence of marrow aplasia. Reviewing data on these patients and recent literature indicate that fatal marrow aplasia seems to occur more frequently in sero-negative women who respond well to therapy with gold salts. Frequent blood monitoring in search for any pronounced or sustained drop in red, white or platelet count, even within normal range could serve as a warning sign for myelotoxicity. Despite intensive supportive measures and specific therapeutic attempts, all three patients eventually died of septic shock.",1987,12
1083,3465489,Pharmacokinetic determinants of 6-mercaptopurine myelotoxicity and therapeutic failure in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"The pharmacokinetics of oral 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) was assessed in 20 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during maintenance therapy. The AUC was between 0 and 6 X 10 ng X min/ml, and AUC normalized to 1 mg/m2 of 6MP was between 0 and 815 ng X min/ml. Good correlation existed between peak concentrations and AUC (r = 0.866; P less than 0.001). In more than half of the cases there was evidence of prolonged elimination t1/2 or rebound of a serum concentration during the elimination phase corresponding to either an additional compartment or enterohepatic circulation of 6MP. One child did not achieve detectable concentrations on 2 different study days and was switched to a different protocol. The two children who had severe myelotoxicity achieved the largest AUC values per milligram per square meter of 6MP. Our results indicate that pharmacokinetic variability may contribute to either severe myelotoxicity or therapeutic failures. This suggests that monitoring of this drug in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia may be helpful.",1986,12
1084,3470173,Cytarabine-induced cerebellar syndrome: case report and literature review.,"High-dose cytarabine (HDARAC) therapy is an effective regimen in treating refractory leukemias. A typical regimen is cytarabine 3 g/m2 iv over one to three hours q 12h for a total of 8 to 12 doses. This case report illustrates the neurotoxicity unique to HDARAC. The patient received two cycles of HDARAC over the course of a ten-week period. During the first treatment, dysarthria and ataxia were seen after completion of the patient's eighth and final dose of HDARAC. These symptoms resolved over a period of five days. Six weeks later a more severe syndrome of dysarthria and ataxia developed during a second cycle of treatment. These symptoms worsened over 24 hours despite discontinuation of therapy, then gradually decreased in severity but persisted until his death two months later. The neurotoxicity seen with HDARAC is dose-related and has occurred in up to 60 percent of treated patients. The incidence of cerebellar toxicity approaches 30 percent, with irreversible ataxia reported in up to 16.7 percent. Because the cerebellar toxicity may be worsened by continuation of therapy after initial onset of symptoms, prompt termination of HDARAC is recommended.",1987,2
1085,3485422,Macular infarction after endophthalmitis treated with vitrectomy and intravitreal gentamicin.,"We encountered two cases of macular infarction that occurred after vitrectomy performed for mild endophthalmitis, which, on culture, yielded Staphylococcus epidermidis. At the end of each vitrectomy, 0.4 mg of gentamicin, 1.0 mg of cefazolin, and 0.32 mg of dexamethasone were injected into the vitreous cavity. We are concerned that the macular lesion was a retinal toxic effect of gentamicin because of the recent description of similar lesions occurring after the inadvertent intraocular injection of massive doses of this drug.",1986,3
1086,3493797,"Psoriasis, razoxane and a cutaneous B-cell lymphoma.","A woman with a 20-year history of acral pustular psoriasis of Hallopeau and recurrent pustular lesions of the forearms and lower legs, developed a B-cell lymphoma of the lip following 4 1/2 years of treatment with razoxane.",1987,2
1087,3501467,Hypogammaglobulinemia associated with gold therapy: evidence for a partial maturation blockade of B cells.,Extensive immunological investigations were performed in a patient with definite seronegative rheumatoid arthritis who developed hypogammaglobulinemia in the course of gold therapy. The data obtained suggest the presence of acquired maturation abnormalities in the B cell compartment.,1987,10
1088,3508194,Transient leucopenia and thrombocytopenia associated with sodium nitroprusside infusion.,The case history of a 42 year old male on CAPD who was receiving sodium nitroprusside (SNP) for hypertensive encephalopathy is described. Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia developed but were resolved by hydroxocobalamin infusion during administration.,1987,6
1089,3513544,Herpes simplex esophagitis in a renal transplant patient treated with cyclosporine A: a case report.,"Herpes simplex esophagitis is a rare disease occurring mostly in immunocompromised and cancer patients. We report the first case of herpes esophagitis in a renal transplant patient treated with Cyclosporine A while on chronic steroid therapy. With the increasing use of Cyclosporine A in transplant patients, the incidence of herpes esophagitis may increase. The disease is suggested endoscopically by its typical appearance. The diagnosis is confirmed by cytology, tissue studies, and viral cultures. Based on the limited knowledge of the natural history of herpetic esophagitis and lack of prospective antiviral trials, symptomatic therapy with viscous Xylocaine appears reasonable. The definitive role of antiviral therapy is yet to be clarified.",1986,3
1090,3528096,Rebound hyperglycemia following overdosing of insulin in cats with diabetes mellitus.,"Posthypoglycemic hyperglycemia (rebound hyperglycemia) after overdosing of insulin was diagnosed in 6 cats with diabetes mellitus. Administration of excessive insulin induced hypoglycemia within 4 to 8 hours, followed by rebound hyperglycemia. Diagnosis was made by serial blood glucose determinations during a 20- to 24-hour period after insulin administration. Four cats had a history of difficulty in regulating the diabetic state. In 2 cats, rebound hyperglycemia was diagnosed on routine serial blood glucose determinations. All of the cats were hyperglycemic for most of the day. Rebound hyperglycemia was observed with both intermediate (neutral protamine hagedorn) and long-acting (protamine zinc iletin) insulins, and the range of insulin doses at which the disorder developed overlapped previously determined therapeutic doses for these insulins in the cat. Urine glucose and single afternoon blood glucose determinations were inadequate and potentially misleading in monitoring diabetic cats receiving excessive amounts of insulin.",1986,6
1091,3542612,Captopril-induced lichen planus pemphigoides with pemphigus-like features. A case report.,"We report a case of a bullous lichenoid eruption due to the intake of captopril. Clinical, histological, direct immunofluorescence and ultrastructural features were consistent with the diagnosis of lichen planus pemphigoides. In addition, the in vivo immunological study also revealed an intercellular fluorescence, similar to that seen in pemphigus. Complex drug-induced cutaneous reactions have been previously reported with other drugs, especially with D-penicillamine, which bears chemical similarities with captopril. However, such a drug-induced mixed pattern of lichen planus pemphigoides with pemphigus-like features has never been reported.",1986,0
1092,354311,Metastatic osteomyelitis following BCG vaccination.,"An 8-year-old girl, who had been vaccinated with BCG without subsequent regional reactions, developed osteomyelitis in the left calcaneus 7 months later. The process healed after surgical treatment and chemotherapy for 1 year. Culture from the bone abscess gave growth of mycobacteria which could not be distinguished from BCG.",1978,4
1093,3549808,Deaths occurring during clinical studies of topical minoxidil.,"Eight deaths that occurred during Upjohn-sponsored clinical trials of topical minoxidil and two deaths in subjects who used extemporaneous formulations of the drug are summarized. Of the eight patients in clinical trials, five had cardiovascular abnormalities and two had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related pneumonia. One patient died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. One of the subjects who was using extemporaneous topical minoxidil had hypertension and arteriosclerotic disease and the other died of a myocardial infarction. There is little likelihood of significant adverse effects attributable to topical minoxidil because of its low systemic absorption. The evidence suggests that these deaths were the result of causes other than use of the drug.",1987,3
1094,3558331,Amoxapine-induced cognitive impairment in two patients.,"Two patients are described in whom subtle cognitive impairments are associated with therapeutic doses of amoxapine. The implications of this observation for the management of depression, particularly in patients with coexisting dementing illnesses, are discussed.",1987,4
1095,3565435,Severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction to ibuprofen occurring after prolonged therapy.,"A 23-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to the drug ibuprofen. The reaction, documented by rechallenge during hospitalization, was characterized by marked hypotension, fever, rigors, conjunctivitis, meningitis, nausea, arthralgias, and leukopenia. In addition to illustrating the potential diagnostic confusion with infection or lupus flare, this case is of interest in that the reaction developed suddenly despite the patient's uneventful use of the drug for over two years. Collected cases are reviewed from the literature, and the common features are summarized.",1987,4
1096,3569037,Hypersensitivity reaction following chloramphenicol administration in a patient with typhoid fever.,"Hypersensitivity reactions due to chloramphenicol are rarely reported in the literature. We present a case report of a patient with typhoid fever who experienced a hypersensitivity reaction subsequent to the infusion of chloramphenicol sodium succinate. The patient had previously reacted similarly to ampicillin infusion. A brief review of reported cases of chloramphenicol hypersensitivity in the English-language literature, as well as possible alternative explanations in this case, are provided.",1987,4
1097,3579660,Worsening of neurologic syndrome in patients with Wilson's disease with initial penicillamine therapy.,"We describe a patient with Wilson's disease who presented with neurologic disease, was treated with D-penicillamine, and suffered sudden neurologic deterioration coincident with therapy. Replicate brain magnetic resonance imaging examinations after six weeks and 11 months of penicillamine therapy documented the development of new brain lesions during this period, while liver biopsy specimen data disclosed that excellent hepatic decoppering had occurred. To develop information on the relative rarity or frequency of neurologic worsening with the initiation of penicillamine therapy, we conducted a retrospective survey of 25 additional patients with Wilson's disease who met the criteria of presenting with neurologic disease and having been treated with penicillamine. The replies indicate that, at least from the patient's viewpoint, this syndrome occurs frequently. We suggest that the cause of this distressing syndrome, and ways to mitigate or circumvent it, must be discovered.",1987,5
1098,3586163,Upper tract urothelial malignancy after cyclophosphamide therapy: a case report and literature review.,We report an unusual case of simultaneous transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis and distal ureter without transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder occurring after chronic cyclophosphamide therapy for nonHodgkin's lymphoma. Other upper tract neoplasms after cyclophosphamide are reviewed.,1987,6
1099,3604756,Progressive pulmonary fibrosis complicating cyclophosphamide therapy.,"A 26-year-old woman with extra-pulmonary Wegener's granulomatosis was treated with cyclophosphamide for 3.25 years, cumulated dose of 91 g. Six months before cessation of therapy discrete radiological signs of apical fibrosis appeared. The changes were progressive regardless of discontinuation of cyclophosphamide and led to severe restrictive ventilatory defect.",1987,0
1100,3609047,Torsade de pointes during loading with amiodarone.,Torsade de pointes represents a potential complication of chronic amiodarone therapy. Several reports have emphasized the need for a loading dose in order to achieve therapeutic blood levels rapidly. We report a case of torsade de pointes following a single oral dose of amiodarone (1400 mg or 30 mg kg-1) administered after short intravenous loading for prevention of paroxysmal atrial flutter. Torsades de pointes were preceded and associated with marked QT prolongation and bradycardia. This report suggests that careful monitoring of patients undergoing oral amiodarone loading is necessary.,1987,5
1101,3612639,Pulmonary edema as a delayed complication of ritodrine therapy. A case report.,"Pulmonary edema occurred 24 hours after intravenous ritodrine therapy and 10 hours after subcutaneous terbutaline therapy. Standard therapy directed at volume overload quickly cleared the pulmonary congestion, and the pregnancy progressed uneventfully to term. A retrospective review incriminated transfusion therapy and volume overload as the etiology.",1987,6
1102,3620420,Cyclosporin therapy in Mooren's ulcer.,"Mooren's ulcer is a rare disease of presumed autoimmune aetiology. Some cases run a chronic severe course and fail to respond to local and systemic therapy. We report here such a case with bilateral Mooren's ulcer that failed to respond to local therapy with topical corticosteroids, silver nitrate, and conjunctival resection, as well as systemic immunosuppression with corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine. Systemic cyclosporin (10 mg/kg/day) resulted in resolution of the corneal ulceration within two weeks of beginning treatment, and the patient has remained in remission after 15 months of therapy. Cyclosporin side effects included hirsutism, hypertension, increased blood levels of urea and creatinine, and abnormalities in liver function tests. All these resolved on reducing the dosage of cyclosporin. The results in this case suggest that cyclosporin is an effective agent in patients with severe sight threatening Mooren's ulcer.",1987,6
1103,3628148,Rupture of a cerebral aneurysm associated with nifedipine treatment.,We describe rupture of a cerebral arterial aneurysm in a 32 year old hypertensive woman following the introduction of nifedipine treatment. It is suggested this relationship is causal rather than coincidental and mediated through cerebral arterial vasodilatation.,1986,11
1104,3652934,Prazosin-induced first-dose phenomenon possibly associated with hemorrhagic stroke: a report of three cases.,"A small initial dose of prazosin ranging from 0.5 to 1 mg has been recommended to avoid the first-dose phenomenon characterized by a sudden and severe drop in blood pressure after the administration of the first dose of prazosin. However, even with an initial dose of 0.5 mg, hypotension with consciousness disturbance developed in three hypertensive patients with recent cerebral hemorrhage. We present this report to alert physicians and pharmacists about the potential risk of the first-dose phenomenon even at the recommended initial doses of prazosin in hypertensive patients who have suffered a recent stroke.",1987,9
1105,3659584,Massive pulmonary embolism complicating streptokinase treatment for deep vein thrombosis.,"A fatal massive pulmonary embolus developed in a patient treated with streptokinase for acute deep vein thrombosis. This fatal complication occurred despite a careful selection of the patient and the presence of a lytic state. Embolization of a fragmented thrombus or/and attenuation of the lytic state leading to fresh embolization is/are the possible mechanism(s). Although rare, massive pulmonary embolus must be considered to be a major risk of thrombolytic therapy for deep venous thrombosis.",1987,0
1106,3663292,Fatal digoxin poisoning: an unsuccessful resuscitation with use of digoxin-immune Fab.,"A 1-month-old infant suffered cardiac arrest shortly after presentation to the emergency department. The child had a history of heart disease treated with digoxin. The infant died despite intensive resuscitative efforts, including the use of digoxin-specific Fab antibodies. A brief discussion of this case and the use of digoxin-specific antibodies is presented.",1987,11
1107,3677571,Phenytoin-induced hypersensitivity reactions.,"A case of phenytoin-induced hepatitis with mononucleosis is reported, and syndromes associated with phenytoin hypersensitivity reactions are discussed. A 23-year-old black woman with a two-month history of seizure disorder was admitted to a hospital with nausea, vomiting, fever, lymphadenopathy, diffuse maculopapular rash, left-upper-quadrant tenderness, and hepatomegaly. She was receiving phenytoin sodium 300 mg/day; carbamazepine 200 mg four times daily had been discontinued four days before admission because of leukopenia. Phenytoin was discontinued after admission; however, phenytoin 1 g i.v. was given for a tonic-clonic seizure two days after admission, after which swelling of the face and legs and pruritus developed. Over the next few days, signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity progressed, and she became comatose. Seizures were treated with diazepam. She began to recover after 10 days of supportive therapy and was discharged several weeks later on primidone therapy. Serious phenytoin hypersensitivity reactions may appear as dermatologic, lymphoid, or hepatic syndromes. Fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy often accompany hepatic injury. Encephalopathy and death may occur. Proposed mechanisms for phenytoin hypersensitivity include antigen-antibody reactions, alteration of lymphocyte function, and an enzyme abnormality causing the production of toxic metabolites. Treatment is supportive; phenobarbital and carbamazepine may be used with caution as alternate anticonvulsant therapy. The possibility of phenytoin hypersensitivity reactions should be considered when patients receiving phenytoin have unusual symptoms, particularly fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy.",1987,9
1108,3680913,Nicotinic acid-induced fulminant hepatic failure.,"A 46-year-old man began taking nicotinic acid, 3 g daily, for hypercholesterolemia. A month later, he developed clinical and biochemical evidence of modest hepatocellular injury, and therapy was stopped. It was restarted 6 weeks later, and 10 weeks after that, the patient presented with fulminant hepatic failure, which resolved rapidly after cessation of nicotinic acid therapy. We suggest that nicotinic acid was the cause of his liver disease, that this case is of particular note because of the rather short period of therapy before the onset of liver injury and the severity of the hepatic failure, and that the probable increased use of nicotinic acid for serum cholesterol control makes it especially important for physicians and their patients to be alert to the signs of hepatotoxicity.",1987,10
1109,3688031,Choanal atresia and athelia: methimazole teratogenicity or a new syndrome?,"An infant girl with choanal atresia, athelia, minor anomalies, and mild to moderate mental retardation was born to a woman treated for hyperthyroidism throughout pregnancy with methimazole and propranolol. The patient's defects may be due to methimazole teratogenicity or could represent a previously undescribed syndrome affecting ectodermal structures.",1987,12
1110,3693034,Management of cryptococcosis and toxic epidermal necrolysis in a dog.,"Generalized cryptococcosis with CNS involvement was diagnosed in a 3-year-old spayed German Shorthaired Pointer. Clinical findings included Horner's syndrome, generalized lymphadenopathy, temporal muscle atrophy, and chorioretinitis. Toxic epidermal necrolysis resulted after 19 days of treatment with 5-fluorocytosine and amphotericin B. After discontinuation of the 5-fluorocytosine and amphotericin B and treatment with cephradine and ketoconazole, the toxic epidermal necrolysis resolved. Treatment was completed without further complication by using amphotericin B and ketoconazole concurrently.",1987,11
1111,369675,Histiocytic lymphoma of the ileocecal region after chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.,"Histiocytic lymphoma of the ileocecal region developed in a patient with multiple myeloma following successful long-term alkylating agent therapy. Five and one-half years after the diagnosis of myeloma, while in remission on cyclophosphamide therapy, the patient experienced severe abdominal right lower quadrant pain due to a large cecal lymphoma. A right hemicolectomy was performed with relief of symptoms. However, 9 months later, while still asymptomatic, routine physical examination revealed a recurrent right lower quadrant tumor. Radiation therapy decreased the size of the mass, but five months later partial small bowel obstruction occurred because of recurrent lymphomatous infiltration. The patient died 7 years after the diagnosis of myeloma with extensive abdominal lymphoma. There was no evidence of recurrent myeloma after the initial remission on cyclophosphamide therapy. This patient adds to the growing literature of a second malignancy occurring after prolonged successful chemotherapy of a primary neoplasm.",1979,2
1112,3708949,Probable early acute hepatitis with parenteral amiodarone.,"A patient with acute changes suggesting acute hepatitis after parenteral amiodarone administration is described. A 77-year-old man with previous myocardial infarction was admitted with chronic left heart failure and atrial tachycardia. Initial hepatic function tests were strictly normal. After therapy with parenteral amiodarone (2300 mg in 3 days) and other measures, signs of congestive heart failure disappeared; subsequently the patient developed jaundice, marked increase in serum transaminase levels and fall in prothrombin time, and histologic changes of severe centrilobular necrosis were observed in hepatic biopsy. Clinical, laboratory (absence of others markers of hepatic disease), and histological findings seem to rule out common causes of hepatic disease. Therefore, parenteral amiodarone was implicated as the cause of acute hepatitis in this patient. In addition, there were findings suggesting a possibly immunologically mediated mechanism.",1986,5
1113,3718111,"Severe hyperkalemia as a complication of timolol, a topically applied beta-adrenergic antagonist.","Severe hyperkalemia occurred in a patient with radiation pneumonitis and glaucoma shortly after beginning prednisone therapy. There was no evidence of renal failure, diabetes, acidosis, increased potassium intake, or significant tissue trauma. Medications having adverse effects on potassium metabolism were considered, and the patient's use of timolol maleate eyedrops was discontinued. His serum potassium level normalized despite continuation of the prednisone therapy. He became hyperkalemic on rechallenge with timolol and normokalemic following its withdrawal. This case indicates that the potential for beta-blocker-induced hyperkalemia exists even with topical appreciation.",1986,6
1114,3720318,Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema during intrabiliary infusion of mono-octanoin.,Mono-octanoin (glycerol-1-mono-octanoate) is a medium-chain diglyceride used to dissolve gallstones. We describe a patient in whom noncardiogenic pulmonary edema developed during intrabiliary infusion of monooctanoin. The temporal sequence suggests that the drug infusion initiated the lung injury.,1986,7
1115,3725284,Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia during treatment with cisplatin and etoposide combination.,"We report a case of a 60-year-old woman affected by squamous lung carcinoma, who developed paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia during cisplatin and etoposide combination chemotherapy. Cisplatin toxicity on cardiac electrical activity is discussed. This observation might suggest caution when cisplatin is used in patients with cardiac disease or pretreated with other potential cardiotoxic antineoplastic agents.",1986,0

1117,3744305,Two unusual pathological reactions to nitrofurantoin: case reports.,"Idiosyncratic pulmonary reactions to nitrofurantoin are not unusual, often presenting as eosinophilic pneumonia. We report two cases of uncommon pathological reactions, one resembling a hypersensitivity pneumonitis and the other mimicking a giant cell interstitial pneumonia.",1986,7
1118,3753891,Acute myocardial necrosis during administration of amsacrine.,"The authors report a case of focal myocardial necrosis, presenting clinically as an acute myocardial infarction during the administration of the antineoplastic drug, amsacrine, in a patient without coronary artery disease. In addition to the recognized arrhythmic complications, the authors emphasize myocardial necrosis as a possible further manifestation of amsacrine-related cardiotoxicity.",1986,4
1119,3763264,Graft versus host-like illness in a child with phenobarbital hypersensitivity.,"A child in whom a phenobarbital hypersensitivity drug reaction developed which consisted of fever, a pruritic desquamating erythrodermic rash, alopecia, icterus, protein-losing enteropathy, myositis, and nephritis, is described. Laboratory studies demonstrated eosinophilia, elevated serum IgE, and elevated T suppressor/cytotoxic cells in the peripheral blood. Findings from biopsy specimens of skin and jejunum suggested a cell-mediated pathogenesis, and lymphoproliferative studies of the patient's mononuclear cells revealed a positive response to phenobarbital. The clinical findings and laboratory studies suggested an autoimmune cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction triggered by phenobarbital.",1986,10
1120,3767790,Duodenal ulceration: a complication of tolazoline therapy.,Tolazoline Hydrochloride is a pulmonary vasodilator that is used for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Two patients who were receiving Tolazoline by infusion developed duodenal ulceration and subsequent intestinal perforation. This undesirable side effect of Tolazoline may be prevented by the concomitant use of antacids to maintain gastric pH greater than 5.,1986,8
1121,3773837,Macrodantin: a cautionary tale.,"Nitrofurantoin, one of the antimicrobial agents which should be chosen for the prophylactic treatment of recurrent urinary tract infection, may be prescribed in the conventional form or, alternatively, as macrocrystals. The latter form (Macrodantin) is reported to engender less gastrointestinal intolerance but it can produce the same adverse effects as the conventional form--liver damage, acute and chronic pulmonary reactions, peripheral neuropathy, blood dyscrasias and allergic reactions--and does so just as rapidly and floridly; one such case is reported here.",1986,11
1122,3790438,Generalized pustular psoriasis precipitated by trazodone in the treatment of depression.,"Severe psoriasis is commonly associated with depression and may be its cause. The hazards of treating such patients with lithium are well known (Lazarus & Gilgor, 1979), but other drugs may also destabilize psoriasis. We report a patient in whom the anti-depressant trazodone hydrochloride (Molipaxin, Roussel), a serotonin antagonist, provoked generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP).",1986,11
1123,3797173,Medicolegal problems in the management of cardiac arrhythmias in children.,"Malpractice actions against pediatricians treating patients with arrhythmias have been recurrent in four general areas. Optimal medical management may not be widely recognized. Cases illustrating the following concepts are presented. Intravenous verapamil therapy in babies may cause apnea, hypotension, and bradycardia; continued episodes of atrial flutter in a child may cause sudden death; quinidine may be related to the death; children with ""familial seizure disorders"" may in fact have the long QT interval syndrome. The QT interval must be measured on the ECG in patients with unexplained seizures; ""supraventricular tachycardia with aberration"" is uncommon in children. Rapid heart rates with QRS complexes that are different from the sinus complexes are likely to be ventricular tachycardia. These situations must be recognized as potential problems and must be treated appropriately.",1987,1
1124,3804181,Methimazole-associated cholestatic liver injury: case report and brief literature review.,"The authors report a further case of methimazole-associated liver damage and present a brief review of eleven previous cases found in the literature. The main clinical features of this 58-year-old female patient were laboratory evidence of leucopenia and cholestasis, and biopsy features of fatty liver parenchyma degeneration with granulocytic portal infiltration and bile stasis, demonstrated 20 days after the initiation of antithyroid therapy with 20 mg methimazole daily. An immediate cholestatic liver reaction was also provoked by drug rechallenge, with spontaneous amelioration of signs and symptoms after drug discontinuation.",1986,12
1125,3806824,Fibrosis of corpus cavernosum after intracavernous injection of phentolamine/papaverine.,Intracavernous self-injection with vasoactive drugs is a new treatment for impotence. Although few reports of side effects have been published complications such as priapism and fibrosis of the spongy tissue are of concern. We report a case of penile fibrosis after intracavernous self-injection of a combination of phentolamine and papaverine.,1987,2
1126,3815268,Pulmonary sarcoidosis following interferon therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma.,A 57-year-old woman developed pulmonary sarcoidosis during therapy with interferon beta for advanced renal cell carcinoma metastatic to mediastinal lymph nodes. The possible role of interferon beta in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis in this patient is discussed.,1987,3
1127,3824704,"Fatal outcome of intravesical formalin instillation, with changes mimicking renal tuberculosis.","Intravesical formalin instillation has been performed in a patient with massive bladder hemorrhage secondary to radiation cystitis. Stricture formation at the level of the calyceal infundibula occurred, as well as retroperitoneal and ureteric fibrosis. The literature concerning formalin therapy is reviewed.",1986,0
1128,3868420,Hydatid disease: the alveolar variety in Australia. A case report with comment on the toxicity of mebendazole.,"The alveolar form of hydatid disease, caused by the larval stage of the cestode Echinococcus multilocularis, is virtually confined geographically to the northern hemisphere. It produces clinically malignant multivesicular infiltrating lesions most often in the liver, and is quite different from the usual cystic variety caused by E. granulosus. We present a case report of a patient with alveolar hydatid disease, whose treatment with mebendazole was brief due to side effects of alopecia and granulocytopenia; and review the features of this disease which, with increasing international migration, may be encountered more frequently in Australia.",1985,10
1129,3873709,"Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, pseudomembranous colitis, and spinal cord injury.","Antibiotic-associated colitis (pseudomembranous colitis) developed in four patients with spinal cord injury and taking oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. One hundred forty-eight (59%) of 251 patients with spinal cord injury who were evaluated had received this drug. Two of the four patients with pseudomembranous colitis did not promptly respond to therapy, and all four suffered significant further immobilization because of the disease. Pseudomembranous colitis readily occurs in at least certain population groups receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.",1985,6
1130,3878320,A lethal complication of peripheral vein vasopressin infusion.,A patient bleeding from oesophageal varices in whom injection sclerotherapy failed to control bleeding required peripheral vein vasopressin infusion for a total of five days. Three days after stopping the infusion she collapsed and died. Post mortem examination showed the cause of death to be intestinal infarction resulting from superior mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis. This complication has not previously been described in association with vasopressin infusion into peripheral veins. The duration of each infusion should be minimised and blood volume should be carefully monitored throughout. The condition should be suspected in patients who develop unexplained abdominal pain or collapse following vasopressin treatment.,1985,10
1131,3892171,Protamine-induced fatal anaphylaxis. Prevalence of antiprotamine immunoglobulin E antibody.,"Protamine is used widely to reverse the anticoagulant effects of heparin and to delay the absorption of insulin. Although adverse reactions to protamine are reported infrequently and are usually mild, we recently observed the first fatal case of type I anaphylaxis resulting from protamine. This patient had previously been sensitized to protamine during cardiac catheterization and had high levels of protamine-specific immunoglobulin E in the serum. In a prospective study, we found that 10 of 19 diabetic patients (53%) who had received insulin containing insulin also had high levels of antiprotamine immunoglobulin E. In contrast, none of 27 nondiabetic healthy normal controls or 10 diabetics who had never received protamine or protamine-containing insulin had levels of antiprotamine immunoglobulin E over background. This study underscores the risks of routinely administering protamine to susceptible individuals and the need for alternative therapies.",1985,7
1132,3899068,The importance of high-tone audiometry in monitoring for ototoxicity.,"Early detection of ototoxicity is of vital importance in cases in which ototoxic drugs are administered. Ototoxicity as a result of cis-platinum administration is well documented. Auditory damage may be reduced by changes in dose, drugs or methods of treatment. As ototoxicity appears to be most pronounced in the higher frequencies of sound, any changes can be assessed at an earlier stage by using high-frequency audiometry to test patients at frequencies from 8 to 20 kHz. Our present study demonstrates the utility of monitoring auditory function at frequencies higher than conventionally tested in patients receiving cis-platinum.",1985,0
1133,3917429,Non-lithium-induced renal failure with secondary lithium toxicity: case reports.,"Two manic-depressive patients are described who presented with acute renal failure and concurrent lithium toxicity. In both cases the etiology of the renal failure was not a direct result of the use of lithium. Controversy concerning the nephrotoxicity of lithium is discussed, and recommendations for the evaluation of renal failure during lithium therapy are provided.",1985,1
1134,3926849,Paradoxical pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by nitroglycerin in idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.,Administration of intravenous nitroglycerin in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension resulted in an increase in pulmonary artery pressure associated with a decrease in blood flow that is best explained by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. This observation highlights the need for hemodynamic monitoring when potent vasodilators are used in this disorder.,1985,8
1135,3941210,Atrioventricular block complicating amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism in a patient with pre-excitation and rate-dependent bilateral bundle branch block.,"As a clinical entity atrioventricular (AV) block due to hypothyroidism is rare. Such a case induced by hypothyroidism complicating long-term therapy with amiodarone in a 45 year old woman with pre-excitation is presented. Electrophysiologic data obtained before and during thyroxine replacement therapy showed that hypothyroidism lengthens the effective refractory period of the atria, AV node, bypass tract and His-Purkinje system (that in the ventricle not being measured); this lengthening resembles the effects of long-term administration of amiodarone. These observations suggest that depressed thyroid function may be protective against arrhythmias but a patient with preexisting conduction system disease may develop AV block. The tendency to develop AV block in a patient who is euthyroid was reduced by bypass tract conduction. These findings are significant not only in monitoring amiodarone effects during chronic prophylactic drug therapy but also in providing further insight into the complex interrelation between the action of the drug and the thyroid hormones on cardiac muscle.",1986,1
1136,3947272,Ampicillin may aggravate clinical and experimental myasthenia gravis.,Ampicillin trihydrate aggravated the symptoms of two myasthenic patients. One patient had severe temporary weakness after an ampicillin sodium challenge. Ampicillin increased the preexisting electrical decrement in three rabbits with experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis while the drug had no deleterious effects in less affected or normal animals. Myasthenic patients receiving ampicillin should be closely monitored for possible acute exacerbations.,1986,3
1137,3954165,Perforated gastric ulcer in an asthmatic treated with theophylline and steroids. Case report and literature review.,"We presented a patient with status asthmaticus treated with a combination of theophylline and prednisone who developed a perforated gastric ulcer. The relative etiologic significance of the stress of status asthmaticus, administration of theophylline, or corticosteroids is open to question. The literature, except for anecdotal reports, does not support a significant increase of ulcers in asthmatic patients on either theophylline or steroids. A study following large patient groups on theophylline and a combination of theophylline and steroids might clarify the risk of ulcer formation in patients being treated with these medications for asthma.",1986,3
1138,3964363,Esophageal spasm following propranolol overdose relieved by glucagon.,A case of propranolol overdose complicated by esophageal spasm preventing extrication of an orogastric lavage tube and relieved by intravenous glucagon is presented. Esophageal spasm is an infrequent complication of beta-adrenergic over-dose. Possible mechanisms of esophageal spasm and its relief with glucagon are discussed.,1986,5
1139,3967536,Hypotension and sinus arrest with nifedipine in pulmonary hypertension.,An adverse reaction to the acute administration of sublingual nifedipine is reported. Subsequent reversal was by intravenous administration of calcium chloride.,1985,2
1140,3970339,Ischaemia following selfadministered intra-arterial injection of methylphenidate and diamorphine. A case report of treatment with intra-arterial urokinase and review.,"A patient presented with a painful, oedematous, cyanosed hand having injected a solution of diamorphine and methylphenidate into his radial artery. Treatment was started with heparin and vasodilators. Benefit from this was limited and a course of intra-arterial urokinase was instituted. This gave almost total resolution of the injury. The mechanisms producing ischaemia following intra-arterial injection of drugs of abuse and possible treatment are discussed.",1985,1
1141,3977377,Thiazide diuretic therapy and chronic photosensitivity.,Chronic photosensitivity associated with hydrochlorothiazide ingestion occurred in four patients. These patients developed a debilitating photosensitivity that persisted for months to years even after they stopped taking the diuretic. Their age range was 44 to 66 years. Phototesting with ultraviolet B (UV-B) and ultraviolet A (UV-A) radiation revealed decreased minimal erythemal doses for one or both wave bands in all patients tested. Histologic examination of skin biopsy specimens from the patients' UV-B and UV-A test sites and lesional skin revealed an acute eczematous dermatitis. Treatment with methoxsalen and UV-A radiation successfully cleared the photosensitive eruption in the patients.,1985,4
1142,3982906,Cardiac decompensation following verapamil therapy in infants with supraventricular tachycardia.,"Three infants with supraventricular tachycardia and congestive cardiac failure were given verapamil intravenously. In two of the infants, the rhythm was converted to sinus, but the third infant required direct current cardioversion. However, each infant demonstrated hemodynamic decompensation shortly after verapamil administration and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation. All three patients were stabilized and their tachycardia was controlled with digoxin. All three were doing well at the time of follow-up evaluation, and there was no evidence of structural heart disease. The risk of cardiac decompensation in infants with supraventricular tachycardia and congestive cardiac failure should be kept in mind prior to administration of verapamil. Alternative methods for conversion of supraventricular tachycardia should be considered.",1985,4
1143,3997294,Pneumonitis with pleural and pericardial effusion and neuropathy during amiodarone therapy.,"A patient with sinuatrial disease and implanted pacemaker was treated with amiodarone (maximum dose 1000 mg, maintenance dose 800 mg daily) for 10 months, for control of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. He developed pneumonitis, pleural and pericardial effusions, and a predominantly proximal motor neuropathy. Immediate but gradual improvement followed withdrawal of amiodarone and treatment with prednisolone. Review of this and previously reported cases indicates the need for early diagnosis of amiodarone pneumonitis, immediate withdrawal of amiodarone, and prompt but continued steroid therapy to ensure full recovery.",1985,5
1144,4004433,Heparin-induced hyperkalemia.,"Heparin sodium is routinely used in the prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis in medical and surgical patients. While most physicians are aware of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and skin necrosis, the association of heparin and hyperkalemia is less well recognized. We present four cases in which the use of heparin was associated with hyperkalemia and discuss the pathophysiology. Our findings suggest that hyperkalemia can develop with the use of low-dose heparin, within seven days of initiating heparin therapy, and that patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal insufficiency are especially predisposed to this complication.",1985,6
1145,4014301,Insulin-induced cardiac failure.,"Self-limited edema is a well-recognized complication of insulin therapy. However, progression to overt cardiac failure has only recently been reported in one patient with pre-existing heart disease. This report describes the first case of insulin-induced cardiac failure in a patient without underlying heart disease. Current trends toward intensive insulin therapy for rapid near-normalization of blood glucose levels will increase the recognition of this entity. Careful follow-up of so-called ""self-limited"" insulin edema is encouraged, and the early institution of diuretic therapy is advocated in elderly patients to prevent the development of overt cardiac failure.",1985,7
1146,4018433,Pyridoxine for neonatal seizures: an unexpected danger.,"A case of pyridoxine-dependent seizures is reported. Administration of pyridoxine to an infant after a long period of convulsions was followed by acute hypotonia. Other cases have been reported in the literature, in one of which assisted ventilation was required. A possible mechanism for this alarming outcome is discussed, and it is suggested that resuscitation facilities should be quickly available during such trials.",1985,6
1147,4025011,Prolonged severe cholestasis induced by oxacillin derivatives. A report on two cases.,Two patients with osteomyelitis who developed reversible cholestatic jaundice during treatment with oxacillin derivatives are described. The clinical course as well as the biochemical pattern and the investigation of liver biopsy specimens enabled us to establish the diagnoses of drug-induced canalicular and hepatocanalicular cholestasis.,1985,0
1148,4031907,Pellagra encephalopathy among tuberculous patients: its relation to isoniazid therapy.,"Eight cases of pellagra, diagnosed on the grounds of neuropathological findings and retrospective study of clinical data, were found among 106 necropsy cases of tuberculosis. Although these eight patients had shown various mental, neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as skin lesions, the diagnosis of pellagra had not been made clinically. In all the patients, pellagra symptoms appeared during isoniazid therapy. Death occurred 4 to 16 weeks later. Isoniazid inhibits the conversion of tryptophan to niacin and may induce pellagra, particularly in poorly nourished patients. Pellagra should be suspected whenever tuberculous patients under treatment with isoniazid develop mental, neurological or gastrointestinal symptoms, even in the absence of typical pellagra dermatitis.",1985,7
1149,4036917,Reye syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in Michigan.,Reye syndrome (RS) is believed to occur infrequently among children receiving long-term aspirin therapy. We reviewed all cases of RS reported to the Michigan Department of Public Health during 1982 and 1983. Three of the 36 patients were receiving aspirin for the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. All three patients had clinical courses characteristic of RS and two had supportive histologic findings on liver biopsy. The incidence of RS among children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is significantly greater than the incidence of RS among children who do not have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. These findings support previous studies that showed that the use of aspirin during the antecedent illness may be a risk factor for the development of RS. Physicians should be aware of the potential for the development of RS among children who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy for the treatment of systemic inflammatory illnesses.,1985,9
1150,4038927,Adverse effects of atrial fibrillation and syncope induced by calcium-channel blockers in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Calcium-channel blockers are useful for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but, their adverse effects, especially, those of diltiazem, have not been of much concern. Forty patients with HCM were treated with calcium-channel blockers such as nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil. Atrial fibrillation was induced by diltiazem in two patients and verapamil induced syncope in one patient. The clinical and hemodynamic characteristics of the patients were as follows. All of them had the obstructive type of HCM (HOCM). One of them had a high pressure gradient of the left ventricular outflow tract and the others had earlier onset. In these patients, the left atrial overload seemed to be severe. The vasodilating action of calcium-channel blockers decreases the systemic pressure and in turn, may increase the pressure gradient and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure causes the left atrial overload which could be at risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with HCM. Therefore, calcium-channel blockers should be used carefully in peculiar cases of HOCM.",1985,3
1151,4044222,Amiodarone-induced dysthyroidism.,"A 54-year-old man, treated with amiodarone, developed thyrotoxicosis. When rechallenged with the same drug 6 months later, he developed hypothyroidism. The therapeutic implications of this clinical sequence are discussed.",1985,7
1152,4051280,Propranolol-induced hypertension in treatment of cocaine intoxication.,"The case of a patient with apparent cocaine toxicity and drug-mediated hypertension and tachycardia is presented. IV propranolol was used as the initial treatment for his hyperadrenergic state, resulting in a decrease in heart rate but a paroxsymal increase in blood pressure. The patient required nitroprusside for control of elevated blood pressure. A mechanism of unopposed alpha stimulation as a result of beta-2 receptor blockade is proposed, and a cautious approach to the use of propranolol in these patients is suggested.",1985,11
1153,4054170,Chlorambucil central nervous toxicity: a significant side effect of chlorambucil therapy in childhood nephrotic syndrome.,"Chlorambucil (CHL) was used in combination with prednisolone in the treatment of nine children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. Serial electroencephalograms were obtained to evaluate CHL central nervous toxicity, before, during and after treatment with this agent. EEG abnormalities were observed in two of the nine children during chlorambucil therapy. EEG changes were diffuse spike and wave complexes and disappeared after discontinuation of therapy. There were no other neurological abnormalities and more particularly, no seizures or myocloni were observed. According to the literature, chlorambucil central nervous toxicity is found almost exclusively in childhood nephrotic syndrome. Strict neurological supervision of patients treated with chlorambucil is recommended.",1985,9
1154,4063627,Fenclofenac-induced selective IgA deficiency in rheumatoid arthritis.,A 35-year-old man with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis developed selective IgA deficiency during treatment with fenclofenac. His arthritis remained quiescent while taking the drug and following its withdrawal his condition relapsed and his serum IgA level returned to normal. This case demonstrates the association of selective IgA deficiency with remission in rheumatoid arthritis induced by fenclofenac as well as aurothiomalate and sulphasalazine. It also shows severe relapse after withdrawal of fenclofenac.,1985,11
1155,4066620,The elicitation of a movement disorder by trazodone: case report.,"A 65-year-old woman with bipolar disorder and complicated cardiovascular disease who was on maintenance lithium therapy developed a movement disorder following high doses of trazodone for treatment of an acute depression. When the trazodone was reduced, the involuntary movements promptly ceased. Although the movement disorder could not with certainty be attributed to trazodone alone, the drug at least acted as an eliciting agent.",1985,12
1156,4075534,Spindle coma in benzodiazepine toxicity: case report.,A forty-two year old female with known alcoholic liver disease was given intravenous lorazepam and diazepam for delirium tremens. This resulted in a comatose state with depression of some brainstem reflexes. Her initial EEG showed a pattern of spindle coma with some responsivity of the background. Clinical improvement occurred with cessation of the benzodiazepines and the EEG showed a return to normal patterns. A review of the literature showed no previous description of this pattern in benzodiazepine coma. Two reports of spindle coma are noted with alcohol and imipramine. The prognostic significance of this pattern in drug overdose is therefore not definitive by itself. Outcome is probably more dependent on the clinical condition of the patient and the reversibility of the drug toxicity.,1985,10
1157,4082283,Rifampicin-induced renal failure.,"Renal failure is a rare complication associated with the use of rifampicin for the treatment of tuberculosis, usually occurring well into the course of therapy. The following is a report of 2 cases of rifampicin-induced renal insufficiency. In the first case oligo-anuric renal failure occurred on the thirteenth day of treatment, after the patient had taken only 9 doses of medication. The second case occurred in a patient who developed renal failure while on daily therapy in the hospital. A literature review revealed 83 other reported cases of rifampicin-induced renal insufficiency. Intermittent or interrupted therapy appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of this complication.",1985,12
1158,4095247,Cerebral and ocular toxicity induced by desferrioxamine.,"Seven patients with rheumatoid disease were given the iron-chelating drug desferrioxamine (DFX) to evaluate its possible anti-inflammatory effects. Two of these patients, who also received the anti-emetic prochlorperazine, lost consciousness for 48-72 h and then fully recovered. Electroencephalography showed abnormalities of the type associated with metabolic disturbance. One of these patients showed pyramidal features and subsequently developed an optic neuropathy and pigmentary retinopathy. Analysis of his cerebrospinal fluid showed a decrease in loosely-bound (catalytic) iron and increase in loosely-bound (catalytic) copper, total iron and products of lipid peroxidation, with values approaching normal as the symptoms resolved. Subsequent in vivo/vitro studies clearly demonstrated that the neurological effects were due to a synergistic action of desferrioxamine and prochlorperazine, probably resulting in exceptional fluxes of intra/extra cellular iron/copper disturbing noradrenergic and serotonergic systems. Two other patients who did not receive prochlorperazine, developed retinal problems which later improved, one after only 15 g of desferrioxamine. Our observations suggest a new model for metabolic encephalopathy studies and provide insight into the mechanisms of pigmentary retinopathy.",1985,7
1159,412488,Gold nephropathy: tissue analysis by X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy.,"Three patients developed proteinuria following gold therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. The clinical syndrome was a self-limiting proteinuria with normal renal function. By light and electron microscopic appearances the renal lesion was an epimembranous deposit form of membranous glomerulopathy. Immunofluorescent study showed granular deposits of IgG and C3 complement along glomerular basement membranes. By X-ray fluorescent spectroscopic examination, gold was seen to be present within the proximal convoluted tubular cells but was not identified in the glomerular subepithelial deposits. These findings are consistent with an immune-complex form of glomerulopathy in which gold is neither the antigen nor a hapten in the glomerular deposits, and they suggest the hypothesis that antibodies to tubular epithelial antigens induced by gold therapy may be a causative factor in the renal disease associated with gold therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.",1977,12
1160,417679,Fat embolism in infancy after intravenous fat infusions.,"Four cases of fat embolism are described in infants receiving prolonged intravenous infusion of fat (Intralipid 20%). This therapeutic complication has been termed 'fat overloading syndrome' but bears a clinical similarity to post-traumatic fat embolism. These 4 cases are the first to be recorded in infancy, and with histopathological proof of fat embolism. These 4 cases are the first to be recorded in infancy, and with histopathological proof of fat embolism. Transient high rates of infusion of Intralipid appears to be a factor in the aetiology of the condition.",1978,3
1161,424824,Methotrexate-induced diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.,"Three patients received respectively 190 mg, 175 mg, and 196 mg of methotrexate and developed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates without evidence of peripheral blood eosinophilia. Sputum in the three cases failed to reveal acid-fast bacilli, pathogenic fungi, or opportunistic organisms by cultures and appropriate stains. Despite discontinuance of the drug and/or institution of corticosteroid therapy, progressive respiratory failure led to death. In all three cases, autopsy revealed gross and microscopic features indistinguishable from those seen in the Hamman-Rich syndrome, and methotrexate hepatotoxicity was present in one. Pulmonary eosinophilia or granulomas, classically seen in previously reported cases of methotrexate pneumonitis, were not observed. It is suggested therefore that methotrexate be added to the list of agents capable of inducing diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Conversely, diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients receiving methotrexate who develop bilateral pulmonary infiltrates seen on chest roentgenograms.",1979,3
1162,426502,Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone following adenine arabinoside administration.,A patient with disseminated herpes zoster developed a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone and profound hyponatremia secondary to the administration of adenine arabinoside.,1979,1
1163,433855,Childhood dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Treatment with methotrexate and prednisone.,"The conditions of three children with dermatomyositis and one child with polymyositis were treated for nine to 31 months with combined prednisone and intravenous methotrexate (1 mg/kg/wk) when prednisone alone was ineffective in controlling the disease or when there were substantial steroid-related toxic effects. All children showed a major clinical improvement within three months despite concomitant reduction of the prednisone dose. Three children completely recovered; one patient relapsed and died. The toxic effects of methotrexate included elevated liver transaminases (3/4), nausea (2/4), abdominal pain (2/4), bone pain (2/4), mild neutropenia (1/4), and mild pruritus (1/4). Intravenous methotrexate is an effective adjunct to steroid therapy in the treatment of steroid-resistant or life-threatening dermatomyositis-polyositis or dermatomyositis-polymyositis complicated by severe steroid-related effects.",1979,4
1164,440873,Dystonia associated with carbamazepine administration: experience in brain-damaged children.,"Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant most effective in treating complex partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. We have cared for three children in whom four episodes of dystonia proceeding to opisthotonus occurred in association with carbamazepine use. The patients, a 4-year-old with microcephaly and severe retardation, a 1-year-old with cerebral dysgenesis, and a 5-year-old with spastic quadriplegia and mild retardation, all had seizures unresponsive to multiple anticonvulsant combinations. In all three patients carbamazepine was introduced and gradually increased to a maximum dosage of 25 mg/kg of body weight per day. Dystonic symptoms began two to three weeks after introduction of therapy and subsided within three weeks after discontinuation. In one child, a second course of carbamazepine resulted in a return of the dystonia. The currently available clinical and neuropharmacologic data suggest that carbamazepine may be an antagonist of dopamine and that this property is responsible for the production of dystonia.",1979,4
1165,448845,Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis in patients using methazolamide for glaucoma.,"Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors used in the treatment of glaucoma, seizure disorders, and hypertension are rarely associated with blood dyscrasias. Several case reports of aplastic anemia with use of acetazolamide, and two cases with use of methazolamide, have appeared in the literature. This article describes two cases of aplastic anemia, at least one of which was almost certainly induced by the use of methazolamide, and one case of agranulocytosis related to the use of methazolamide.",1979,6
1166,458006,Squamous-cell carcinoma arising in a basal-cell epithelioma treated with 5-fluorouracil.,Intralesional injection of 5-fluorouracil has recently been reported as a possible method of treatment for an assortment of benign and malignant cutaneous neoplasms. We report the development of squamous-cell carcinoma within a basal-cell epithelioma that was treated with intralesional injections of 5-FU.,1979,5
1167,464813,Lower extremity arterial insufficiency after long-term methysergide maleate therapy. Its evaluation with Doppler ultrasonic velocity detector.,"Iatrogenic ergotism is the primary source of ergot intoxication. The patient whose case is reviewed had migraine headaches and received methysergide maleate for 13 years. She had, in July 1977, severe claudication of the lower extremities. Measurements of the peripheral arterial circulation were made using the Doppler ultrasonic velocity detector. The extent of disease and subsequent reversal were documented using arteriographic examination. Initial measurements showed the patient was able to walk for one minute and 34 seconds on a treadmill (2 mph, 10% grade) before stopping because of claudication. Symptoms cleared after drug withdrawal and repeated testing produced no claudication. The calculated index (posterior tibial/arm pressure) increased from a mean of 0.22 to 0.74 during the eight-month period following discontinuance of methysergide therapy with no recurrence of migraine headaches. A review of the literature is also presented.",1979,8
1168,480917,Erythema multiforme bullosum due to rifampicin.,A case of Erythema Multiforme Bullosum in patient of lepromatous leprosy with pulmonary tuberculosis due to Rifampicin is described. It is stressed that ethambutol may act as a trigger factor to the toxic effects of Rifampicin.,1979,4
1169,489527,Renal damage associated with long term use of lithium carbonate.,The authors report 2 cases of renal damage associated with lithium carbonate treatment. The relevant literature is reviewed and supports the claim that the lithium ion may be nephrotoxic. The article concludes with practical recommendations for clinical practice until futher evidence regarding this association is available.,1979,11
1170,507889,Squamous cell carcinoma. Occurrence in mycosis fungoides treated with psoralens plus long-wave ultraviolet radiation.,"In two patients with mycosis fungoides, a squamous cell carcinoma developed during therapy with psoralens plus long-wave ultraviolet radiation (PUVA). In both patients the carcinoma developed on areas not usually exposed to sunlight. Before receiving PUVA therapy one patient had been treated with topically applied thiotepa and x-ray irradiation, while in the other patient PUVA was the only treatment received except for topical corticosteroids. The carcinomas developed after a total UVA dose of 2,042 and 1,296 joules/sq cm, respectively.",1979,11
1171,515777,Hyperglycemia and diabetic coma: possible relationship to diuretic-propranolol therapy.,"Two patients developed diabetic coma when taking a combination of a thiazide diuretic and propranolol. On subsequent follow-up one patient is taking no insulin and has been maintained on hydrochlorothiazide; the other patient required insulin on two occasions when challenged with a propranolol-thiazide combination, but not when the thiazide was discontinued or replaced with furosemide. These reports suggest the possibility that the risk of developing hyperglycemia and diabetic coma with this combination may be greater than when taking diuretics alone. The mechanism is probably multifactorial.",1979,12
1172,527355,Severe acidosis from acetazolamide in a diabetic patient.,An insulin-dependent diabetic patient with nephropathy developed severe acidosis after treatment with acetazolamide for glaucoma. A renal tubular abnormality may have allowed the usually self-limiting acidosis of acetazolamide to progress. It is suggested that the plasma electrolytes of patients at risk should be monitored.,1979,0
1173,53128,Airway obstruction due to spontaneous retropharyngeal hemorrhage.,A patient is described with polycythemia vera who was taking anticoagulants and developed a spontaneous retropharyngeal hemorrhage after a violent sneezing episode. This progressed to tracheal compression with stridor after he had taken some aspirin for relief of the neck pain. An emergency tracheostomy was life saving.,1975,12
1174,536461,Pseudomembranous colitis in a leukaemia unit: a report of five fatal cases.,"Five cases of clindamycin-associated pseudomembranous colitis in leukaemic patients are reported. These cases were all fatal, and it is suggested that the use of clindamycin in leukaemic patients should be reserved for specific indications.",1979,12
1175,556126,Pituitary tumor made symptomatic during hormone therapy and induced pregnancy.,"An infertile patient with amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome lost vision during a pregnancy occurring after Bromocryptine treatment. A pituitary adenoma was removed, vision recovered, and the pregnancy completed successfully. Two prior episodes of visual loss had occurred during oral contraceptive treatment, an association not heretofore reported. Intrasellar and parasellar tumors made manifest by hormonal influences of pregnancy may become more common as treatment of infertility becomes more refined and successful.",1979,11
1176,566977,Fatal complication of intravesical formalin during control of intractable hemorrhage from radiation cystitis.,Fatal acute tubular necrosis occurred in 1 patient in whom intravesical formalin was used to control massive persistent hemorrhage from radiation cystitis. A suggestion is made to monitor blood formic acid levels and institute prompt dialysis whenever these exceed 80 mg. per 100 ml. to avert such a catastrophe. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate appears to be indicated prophylactically in combating the associated metabolic acidosis due to absorbed formic acid.,1978,6
1177,573779,"Single case study. Amoxapine, a new antidepressant, appears in human milk.","A young woman developed galactorrhea during treatment with a new dibenzoxazepine antidepressant, amoxapine. Both amoxapine and its active and major metabolite, 8-OH-amoxapine, appeared in breast milk. More recent literature suggests that probably all antidepressants can appear in human milk.",1979,10
1178,576675,Edema associated with ibuprofen therapy.,A 15-kg weight gain developed in a patient during the third week of ibuprofen therapy. The edema disappeared with discontinuation of the drug regimen and did not reappear during a subsequent six-month observation period. It should be recognized that ibuprofen may be associated with salt and water retention in the same fashion as previously described with phenylbutazone and indomethacin.,1977,4
1179,578255,Allopurinol-associated hand and foot deformities in chronic tophaceous gout.,"Telescoped digits of the hands and feet developed in a 69-year-old male with severe chronic tophaceous gout during allopurinol treatment. Extensive osseous tophi, resorbed rapidly during therapy with this xanthine oxidase inhibitor and not replaced by new bone matrix, were responsible for the deformity. Several hypotheses are advanced to explain the failure of bone erosions to heal.",1977,10
1180,582099,Acute toxic delirium. Neurotoxicity of intrathecal administration of amphotericin B.,"A patient with coccidioidal meningitis was treated with intrathecally administered amphotericin B, and an acute toxic delirium with EEG abnormalities developed. Clinical recovery followed discontinuation of therapy and paralleled EEG resolution. This complication was dose related and argues for caution when initiating intrathecal therapy with amphotericin B at doses greater than 0.025 mg.",1979,6
1181,58443,Aorto-oesophageal fistula complicating carcinoma of the oesophagus. Review of the literature and report of a case following irradiation and cytostatic therapy.,"Aortic perforation complicating carcinoma of the oesophagus is extremely uncommon. In keeping with findings in the literature, the aortic wall in this case was damaged by secondary changes following irradiation and Bleomycin treatment. Extensive necrosis of normal tissues was a prominent feature and it is suggested that the action of radiation in combination with cytostatic therapy on normal tissues need further investigation.",1976,0
1182,589261,Doxorubicin cardiotoxicity: possible role of digoxin in its prevention.,"Twenty-nine patients with gynaecological cancers who received over 400 mg of doxorubicin were monitored electrocardiographically to determine whether cardiac glycosides countered the adverse effects of high total doses of doxorubicin. Minor electrocardiographical changes were noted in five out of six patients who were not receiving a cardiac glycoside and four out of six who were receiving ouabain, and none of the 16 who were receiving digoxin. One other patient on digoxin stopped taking it and developed cardiomyopathy. One patient on ouabain also developed cardiomyopathy. So far nine patients on digoxin have received between 550 and 1000 mg/m2 of doxorubicin without ill effect. Cardiac glycosides are thought to prevent doxorubicin cardiomyopathy by competitively inhibiting doxorubicin at its receptor sites, but ouabain has a much shorter half life than doxorubicin and its metabolites and so is less effective than digoxin.",1977,12
1183,6093724,Hypersensitivity reaction to sulindac (Clinoril).,"Sulindac (Clinoril), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, has few reported neurologic toxic effects, all of which have been associated with systemic disease. To our knowledge, we describe the first reported case of isolated paresthesia and peripheral neuropathy, without systemic involvement, secondary to sulindac administration. A healthy, 30-year-old man, exposed to sulindac on two separate occasions, had an incapacitating isolated idential sensory neuropathy. The onset and duration of symptoms correlated directly to drug ingestion. This hypersensitivity response cannot be explained pathophysiologically by any mechanism. Repeated exposure and rechallenge of the subject to sulindac was deemed too dangerous, and precludes exact method to establish mechanisms to explain this transient, reproducible, idiosyncratic, adverse drug reaction.",1984,11
1184,6102186,Schizophrenia-like psychosis caused by a metabolic disorder.,"Four patients with an intermittent psychosis closely resembling hallucinogenic drug-induced states were suspected of having a porphyric disease and were investigated for a possible relation between the metabolic dysfunctions of porphyria and the psychotic syndrome. Theoretically the link could be in a disturbance of serine and glycine metabolism. This theory was supported by disturbances in serine and glycine excretion found in all patients during psychotic episodes. In addition, loading with one low oral dose of serine produced psychotic symptoms 5 h later which lasted 3-6 h. One patient reacted to glycine in the same way. These findings suggest that disturbed serine-glycine metabolism may have a key role in certain schizophreniform psychotic syndromes.",1980,3
1185,6108450,Reversal of ergotamine-induced arteriospasm by mechanical intra-arterial dilatation.,"Two patients with imminent gangrene of the extremities caused by ergot-induced arteriospasm underwent mechanical dilatation of the arteries when conventional measures such as anticoagulation, vasodilation, and sympathetic blockade produced no improvement. Dilatation by a balloon-tipped catheter produced an immediate and sustained reversal of the arteriospasm, together with a dramatic relief of symptoms and signs.",1980,12
1186,6113770,New data on lithium and haloperidol incompatibility.,"The authors describe a case of combined lithium and haloperidol toxicity characterized by hyperpyrexia, severe rigidity, mutism, and development of irreversible tardive dyskinesia. This case is similar to four other cases described in the literature and to the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The authors postulate that two types of combined lithium-neuroleptic toxicity occur: a neuroleptic malignant extrapyramidal syndrome and a lithium toxicity that occurs in combination with phenothiazines, primarily thioridazine. Possible mechanisms and preventive measures are discussed.",1981,6
1187,6142995,Chlorambucil-induced chromosome damage to human lymphocytes is dose-dependent and cumulative.,"Sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), a sensitive measure of chromosome damage, were counted in peripheral-blood lymphocytes from 10 patients with Behcet's syndrome receiving chlorambucil. All patients had abnormal counts. Damage was related to both daily dose and duration of therapy and was occurring at a greater rate than its repair. The patient who had been treated the longest and had received the highest total dose also had the highest SCE count. He died from acute leukaemia. SCE analysis may provide a method for detecting patients at risk from oncogenic effects of cytotoxic drugs.",1984,2
1188,6159523,Anaphylactoid reaction to 50% solution of dextrose.,"Two patients with extrinsic asthma and coexistent insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus sustained an anaphylactoid reaction after the intravenous administration of 50% solution of dextrose. Investigations suggested that the dextrose, rather than any additives, was responsible for the reaction. The effect of varying concentrations of dextrose on the histamine content of the blood of normal, allergic, non-diabetic and diabetic, and non-allergic patients was studied. Preliminary results suggest that the higher concentrations of dextrose induce increased histamine release from blood cells, and that this phenomenon is more marked in diabetic, and particularly diabetic-allergic, individuals. We suggest that the treatment of hypoglycaemia with 50% solution of dextrose is associated with a significant risk factor in those diabetic individuals who are either allergic or are receiving beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs.",1980,9
1189,6197014,Salicylate hepato toxicity in rheumatic fever.,Two children with rheumatic fever developed anicteric hepatitis while on high-dose aspirin therapy. The striking chemical abnormality was an elevation of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) [aspartate aminotransferase (AST)]. A percutaneous liver biopsy obtained from one of the patients showed ultrastructural abnormalities consistent with a toxic hepatitis and hepatic congestion. An awareness of this potential complication is important when treating children with aspirin at doses previously considered to be non-toxic.,1983,6

He subsequently had a resolution of all signs and symptoms, suggesting that these alarming events were a toxic but reversible side effect of the chemotherapy.",1983,6
1191,6221046,"Multiple complications of propylthiouracil treatment: granulocytopenia, eosinophilia, skin reaction and hepatitis with lymphocyte sensitization.","An association of granulocytopenia, eosinophilia, skin reaction and hepatitis during propylthiouracil (PTU) therapy for thyrotoxicosis in a 47 year old black female is reported. Clinical and biochemical abnormalities disappeared soon after discontinuation of PTU. That the drug was directly responsible for the observed complications is suggested by the clinical course and by in vitro lymphocyte transformation studies. The latter revealed sensitization to PTU during the acute phase of the disease, which was greatly reduced 5 weeks after discontinuation of the drug and was completely absent after 5 months.",0,0
1192,623061,Toxic encephalopathy related to antihistamine-barbiturate antiemetic medication.,"A toxic encephalopathy characterized by depressed level of consciousness, marked irritability, and ataxia developed in seven children, 5 years of age and younger, following administration of an antiemetic combination of pentobarbital and pyrilamine maleate. Three of the seven patients were given a dosage of medication and exceeding the manufacture's recommendation. All seven patients recovered without sequelae.",1978,1
1193,6233326,Optic neuropathy associated with penicillamine therapy in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.,Optic neuropathy developed in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis who had been receiving D-penicillamine for about 1 year. An associated finding included a 2+ positive antinuclear antibody test with a titer of 1:320. Optic disc swelling was resolved on high doses of intravenous steroids. The case resembles two previously reported cases of optic neuropathy which occurred in patients with Wilson's disease who were receiving penicillamine.,1984,6
1194,6236730,Transient acute myopia resulting from isotretinoin (accutane) therapy.,"A patient developed transient, acute myopia while on isotretinoin (Accutane) therapy for acne. This idiosynactic adverse reaction has not been previously described. There was a clear relationship between restarting the Accutane and recurrence of the transient myopia.",1984,7
1195,6239881,Allergic contact dermatitis to compound tincture of benzoin.,"Nineteen cases of allergic contact dermatitis to compound tincture of benzoin are described. Patch testing to individual components revealed positive reactions to all ingredients except aloe. An alternative preparation, Mastisol, was successfully used without primarily inducing allergy. It should be considered for use before benzoin because once allergy to benzoin exists, cross-reactions to Mastisol usually occur. This is probably due to the presence of a common ingredient, styrax gum.",1984,11
1196,6245286,Visceral herpesvirus infections in leukemic patients receiving cytarabine.,"Autopsy evidence of herpesvirus infection was found in visceral organs of four leukemic patients who had received large doses of cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside; Ara-C) shortly before their death. In three of these patients the infection was clinically unsuspected; in the fourth, cutaneous herpes zoster developed after administration of 300 mg of cytarabine daily for the preceding five days. Although cytarabine exhibits pronounced in vitro virucidal activity against herpes viruses and has been successfully used in clinical treatment of severe herpesvirus infections, the present findings and a review of the recent literature cast doubt on the antiviral effectiveness of this drug, particularly in already immunosuppressed patients, and suggest instead that such patients actually have an increased risk for development of disseminated herpesvirus infection owing to further depression of host defenses by the drug.",1980,5
1197,6251941,Clinical and morphological features of gold neuropathy.,"Three cases of gold-related neuropathy are reported. Clinical features include an acute, symmetrically progressive polyneuropathy, focal or generalized myokymia and a tendency for initial neurological deterioration followed by improvement, after cessation of chrysotherapy. The degree of clinical recovery related to maximal disability. Morphological findings on sural nerve biopsies revealed both axonal degeneration and segmental remyelination. Similar peripheral nerve histology was seen in a parallel animal study in which the severity of the neuropathy was dose-related.",1980,9
1198,6260900,Intra-neural ceroid-like pigment following the treatment of lepromatous leprosy with clofazimine (B663; Lamprene).,"A 33 year old male Nigerian presented with widespread involvement of peripheral nerves, several of which were tender and painful. Nerve biopsies confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium leprae in both endoneurial and perineurial areas, mainly in foamy macrophages (Virchow cells), but there were also large accumulations of an amorphous, acid-fast and alcohol-fast material which was not obviously of bacterial origin. Appropriate stains indicated that this had many characteristics of lipofuscin. Although not previously known, it was at this stage discovered that the patient had received treatment with anti-leprosy drugs nearly three years before presentation in this country. One of these was clofazimine, an aniline aposafranine derivative known to produce a ceroid-like pigment in the tissues of patients treated with this drug or lepromatous leprosy.",1981,2
1199,6292681,Severe neurotoxicity with methyl G: CALGB experience.,"Methylglyoxal bis-dihydrochloride is a drug that has been available for use in cancer chemotherapy since 1955. In earlier studies, it was used on a daily schedule with resulting severe gastrointestinal toxicity and myelosuppression. To avoid that toxicity, a new weekly schedule has been adopted in several Phase II studies. With the weekly schedule, new types of toxicity have been described and we report four patients who have developed a severe sensory-motor neuropathy with the chemotherapy which appears to be drug-related.",1982,0
1200,6303138,Marked sinus tachycardia resulting from the synergistic effects of marijuana and nortriptyline.,A young patient experienced marked sinus tachycardia while smoking marijuana and receiving therapeutic doses of nortriptyline. The authors discuss the potential synergistic effects of these drugs and recommend treatment with propranolol.,1983,5
1201,6311654,Sequential CT studies of 24 children with infantile spasms on ACTH therapy.,"Sequential CT studies were performed in 24 patients with infantile spasms, before, during and after ACTH therapy, in order to analyze the relationship between the dose of ACTH and changes in CT scan findings. In six cases CT scans did not return to their original state after ACTH therapy. Two illustrative cases are reported. There was a good correlation between the total dose of ACTH and the percentage decrease of brain parenchyma. It is concluded that 'cerebral atrophy' on CT scans may represent an accumulative effect of ACTH and that ACTH should be given with the utmost discretion, and in as low a dose as possible.",1983,8
1202,6324592,Disulfiram-like reactions with newer cephalosporins: cefmenoxime.,"A 54-year-old woman with recurrent adenocarcinoma of the uterus was treated with new third-generation cephalosporin, cefmenoxime, for a urinary tract infection. She received an alcohol-containing tylenol elixir while receiving the drug on two occasions. A disulfiram-like reaction was noticed each time. Such reactions have been described in patients receiving certain drugs such as 5-nitroimidazoles, nitrofurans, sulfonylureas and certain newer cephalosporins with a methyltetrazolethiol side chain. This is the first report of a disulfiram-like reaction with cefmenoxime. The mechanism, causes, and significance of disulfiram-like reactions are discussed.",0,0
1203,6329575,Is akathisia a forerunner of tardive dyskinesia? A clinical report with brief review of literature.,"k bipolar manic-depressive patient, developed while on lithium prophylaxis, akathisia at therapeutic serum lithium levels and subsequently bucco-linguo-masticatory dyskinesia. The authors propose that differential involvement of dopamine systems may account for the transition from akathisia to tardive dyskinesia. In the light of a brief review of literature, a prospective study of akathisia and tardive dyskinesia seems justified.",1984,0
1204,633424,Acute leukopenia associated with silver sulfadiazine therapy.,"A patient with a 30% scald burn was treated with topical silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene). On two occasions, within 48 hours of treatment, the patient developed acute leukopenia. Bone marrow aspiration revealed cell maturation arrest. The possible mechanisms of this leukopenia are discussed. It is recommended that daily leukocyte counts be done in burn patients being treated with silver sulfadiazine.",1978,2
1205,6340463,Disseminated histoplasmosis complicating bone marrow transplantation.,"A patient receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplant for treatment of acute myelomonocytic leukemia died on the 78th post-transplant day with clinically unrecognized disseminated histoplasmosis. Granulomas and Histoplasma organisms were found in the histologic sections of the marrow aspirate. Patients from endemic areas referred to transplant centers may be at high risk for disseminated histoplasmosis when treated with long-term prednisone for graft-versus-host disease. Aspiration of bone marrow with use of clot sections is a minimally invasive, sensitive, and rapid means of detecting granulomatous infection in such febrile immunosuppressed hosts. Disseminated histoplasmosis has not been described previously as a complication of bone marrow transplantation.",1983,4
1206,6344831,Nonoliguric acute renal failure after captopril therapy.,"In a patient with severe renovascular hypertension, nonoliguric acute renal failure developed after she received captopril treatment. We believe this to be a previously unreported complication. Urine volume ranged from 1,640 to 2,260 mL/24 hr, and serum creatinine level rose from 2.3 to 8.3 mg/dL. There was no evidence of renal hypoperfusion or interstitial nephritis. Acute renal failure most likely was secondary to the nephrotoxic effect of captopril on chronically hypoperfused kidneys. Renal function improved rapidly after withdrawal of the drug therapy.",1983,6
1207,6353252,Captopril-induced acute reversible renal failure.,"We report 5 cases of acute reversible renal failure coinciding with the onset of treatment with captopril in patients with severe drug-resistant hypertension. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence for an immunologic or toxic insult, although in 1 patient we found a transient leukocyturia and mild proteinuria. A mere hypoperfusion of the kidney does not seem sufficient to account for all 5 observations: in 3 of them changes in blood pressure did not parallel changes in renal function. We propose that, in addition to hyperperfusion, captopril alters renal function by an additional intrarenal hemodynamic effect. The 5 patients had severe renovascular disease which might thus represent a significant risk factor in the development of captopril-induced acute renal failure.",1983,0
1208,6362443,A case of mania associated with fluoxetine.,"A depressed woman with no history of bipolar illness developed a manic episode during treatment with fluoxetine. This side effect appears to be a universal property of effective antidepressants, including this new, purely serotonergic agent.",1984,2
1209,6385260,Mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide in advanced breast cancer: a pilot study.,"A trial of combination chemotherapy using mitoxantrone-cyclophosphamide was started in 1983. Sixteen patients with widely metastatic cancer of the breast, including one man, received mitoxantrone, 10 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, followed by cyclophosphamide, 200 mg/m2 by mouth (PO) daily in divided doses on days 3 to 6. It is too early to evaluate four patients at present. The remaining 12 received three or more courses of treatment, and three of these patients achieved a complete response. Another four patients went into partial remission, amounting to an overall response rate of 58%. The other evaluable patients showed stable disease with improved symptoms. Hematologic toxicity was mainly granulocytopenia, but thrombocytopenia occurred in two patients. Alopecia, nausea, and vomiting were attributed to the cyclophosphamide component of the therapy. Mitoxantrone appeared to have no cardiac toxicity. It was concluded that mitoxantrone-cyclophosphamide is an effective chemotherapeutic combination with minimal toxicity and should be further studied in larger controlled trials.",1984,9
1210,6401771,Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome complicating long-term mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil therapy for gastric carcinoma.,"Three cases of acute renal toxicity in patients receiving long-term therapy with mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil are reported. Two of the patients (1 and 3) are from a multicentre trial of adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric carcinoma. All three cases showed extensive fibrin deposition in the kidneys and lungs, the appearances of the renal lesions being similar to those seen in the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome. Two of the three cases had received blood transfusions, and attention is drawn to the possibility that mitomycin C may sensitise the kidneys to minor mismatches. With the increasing use of these antimitotic agents, great vigilance should be exercised with regard to renal function and haemolytic status.",1983,1
1211,640344,Oral 25-hydroxyvitain D3 in treatment of osteomalacia associated with ileal resection and cholestyramine therapy.,"Severe histological osteomalacia developed in a woman with Crohn's disease 2 years after ileal resection and the start of cholestyramine therapy. Treatment with oral 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 50 microgram daily, produced marked biochemical, radiological, and histological improvement after 6 months. It is suggested that cholestyramine, by reducing vitamin D absorption, precipitated the rapid development of osteomalacia in this patient. This case report emphasizes the importance of routine vitamin D supplementation in all patients on long term cholestyramine therapy, and indicates that even in patients with small intestinal disease or resection, oral preparations of vitamin D or its metabolities and analogues may be effective.",1978,5
1212,6405633,Treatment of lithium tremor with metoprolol.,"Two patients with bipolar affective disorder and a history of bronchospastic phenomena experienced tremor during lithium carbonate therapy. In both, metoprolol produced objective and subjective improvement of the tremor without producing bronchospasm. Objective improvement of tremor after use of metoprolol was documented by accelerometry. The authors discuss the implications of these findings.",1983,5
1213,6408978,Tonic status epilepticus presenting as confusional state.,"A 17-year-old epileptic was admitted to the hospital in a confused state. Electroencephalography (EEG) with polygraphic recording revealed tonic status epilepticus. Therapy with phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid, and methylphenidate was unsuccessful. Intravenous diazepam exacerbated the seizures. EEG with polygraphic recording may detect clinically inapparent tonic seizures in epileptics with unexplained confusion, and when generalized paroxysmal fast activity occurs during EEG recording.",1983,5
1214,6414095,Transient hemiparesis caused by phenytoin toxicity. A case report.,A 52-year-old Black woman on phenytoin therapy for post-traumatic epilepsy developed transient hemiparesis contralateral to the injury. The episode appeared to have been precipitated by toxicity due to ingestion of a large amount of phenytoin. A possible mechanism for focal neurological deficit in brain-damaged patients on phenytoin therapy is discussed.,1983,9
1215,6416845,Abnormal metabolism of valproic acid in fatal hepatic failure.,"A 7-year-old boy developed a severe unilateral grand mal seizure at the age of 5 years (phenobarbitone therapy); 1.5 years later valproate (2-propylpentanoic acid, VPA) was added to the therapy. After a seizure-free period of 3 months the patient died from hepatic failure resembling Reye syndrome. Several plasma and urine samples from the final stage before and during peritoneal dialysis were analyzed by GC/MS. The predominant feature was the abnormally increased formation of both 3 mono- and 4 double unsaturated metabolites of VPA amounting in plasma to 58%-71% of the sum of VPA plus all analyzed metabolites (controls maximal 15%) and in urine to 34%-61% (controls maximal 10%). The beta-oxidation pathway of VPA was shown to be suppressed (lack of 3-keto-VPA), whereas metabolites from the omega-oxidation pathway could still be measured (urinary 5-OH-VPA plus 2-propylglutaric acid ca. 1.6%, controls more than 10%). 4-en-VPA (2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid) (5%-21% in plasma) and 4,4'-dien-VPA (2(2-propenyl)-4-pentenoic acid) (4%-7%) have been found as abnormal unsaturated metabolites not detectable in controls. Additional typical findings were the high excretion of adipic acid, suberic acid, and 4-octen-1,8-dicarboxylic acid demonstrating the enhanced capacity of omega-oxidation in fatty acid oxidation.",1983,10
1216,6422563,Cefoxitin therapy for Mycobacterium fortuitum bacteremia with associated granulomatous hepatitis.,"Mycobacterium fortuitum bacteremia with granulomatous hepatitis complicating home cyclic parenteral nutrition through an indwelling Broviac catheter occurred in a 41-year-old woman. She was successfully treated with intravenous cefoxitin and removal of the indwelling central catheter. The granulomatous hepatitis occurred in the apparent absence of mycobacteria from the liver. Incorrect identification of the organism as Corynebacterium J-K led to a change of antimicrobial therapy and clinical deterioration. It is recommended that acid-fast stains be done on ""diphtheroids"" when such isolates are suspected pathogens.",1984,3
1217,6427463,Stroke-like syndrome after gold sodium thiomalate induced vasomotor reaction.,Vasomotor reactions after gold sodium thiomalate are well recognized. When they do occur they are rarely a clinical problem. We describe a 50-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis in whom a severe postinjection vasomotor reaction was associated with a cerebral vascular accident.,1984,4
1218,6430252,Gold nephropathy due to auranofin obscured by tolmetin pseudoproteinuria.,"A 63-year-old woman with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis was successfully treated with auranofin for 12 months. Heavy proteinuria then developed and the drug was stopped. However, the proteinuria apparently became worse. This was later recognised to be a spurious effect due to the introduction of tolmetin. Renal biopsy showed a type I membranous glomerulonephropathy.",1984,6
1219,6440806,Pulmonary gold toxicity.,"A 52-year-old, white female developed low-grade fever, cough, and dyspnea after 8 weeks treatment with sodium aurothiomalate for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient had severe hypoxemia associated with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Dramatic clinical improvement followed prednisone therapy.",1984,11
1220,644545,Cyclophosphamide pneumonitis.,"Cyclophosphamide can rarely cause interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis. Although it has been reported previously in patients being treated for lymphoma, it occurred in this case in a man under treatment for glomerulonephritis. The temporal sequence of the respiratory insufficiency and the histopathology, when compared to the previous examples in the literature, suggest that cyclophosphamide was aetiologically responsible for the lung disease. There may be an interval of one or more months after discontinuation of cyclophosphamide therapy before clinical or radiological improvement occurs.",1978,2

1222,6460590,Clioquinol intoxication occurring in the treatment of acrodermatitis enteropathica with reference to SMON outside of Japan.,"Many past cases of SMON have occurred in Japan but since 1975 no new cases have been reported. One type of SMON is associated with acrodermatitis enteropathica which has a very high frequency of occurrence in association with administration of clioquinol. Acrodermatitis enteropathica with SMON almost always has a high occurrence of visual impairment, but other sensory disturbances are slight or absent, while common adult SMON is just the opposite. We do not know why these differences occur.",1981,12
1223,647693,Tamoxifen retinopathy.,"Tamoxifen has been used as a chemotherapeutic agent with no serious side effects noted. Four patients receiving high-dose tamoxifen for greater than 1 year have demonstrated similar retinal changes. Three of the four patients had a significant decrease in visual acuity as the result of a retinopathy, primarily affecting the region about the macula accompanied by macular edema. In addition, three of the four patients had unusual corneal changes. These findings suggest that the corneal and retinal changes are the result of a toxic effect of tamoxifen when used in the doses and duration described.",1978,3
1224,6478628,Mammary gigantism and D-penicillamine.,Mammary gigantism is a rare complication of D-penicillamine treatment. We report a further case with pathological and endocrine details together with a review of the seven cases previously reported and possible mechanisms.,1984,9
1225,6484655,Ampicillin-associated seizures.,"Two patients had ampicillin-associated seizures. Although they had complex medical problems, the high serum concentrations of ampicillin at the time of seizures without their recurrence after discontinuing the antibiotic suggest that the seizures were related to the ampicillin therapy.",1984,10
1226,6498095,Pemphigus foliaceus induced by rifampicin.,"Pemphigus foliaceus was seen in a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis during rifampicin therapy. The skin lesions were eczematoid patches, flaccid bullae and crusted plaques on the trunk and extremities, histologically showing a high epidermal blister with acantholysis. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunofluorescent studies. After the patient discontinued rifampicin, the skin lesions cleared completely within 5 weeks without any systemic medication.",1984,11
1227,6507240,"Hyponatremia in patients treated with lorcainide, a new antiarrhythmic drug.","The effects of lorcainide, a new antiarrhythmic drug, on serum electrolytes and osmolality are described in a series of 33 patients with organic heart disease and complex ventricular arrhythmias treated with lorcainide. In eight patients, a mean decrease in serum Na+ of 8.25 +/- 3.2 mEq/L was observed after a single 200 mg intravenous dose of lorcainide. Sixteen of 33 patients developed significant hyponatremia and hypoosmolality during oral treatment with lorcainide. In all except two patients, serum Na+ returned to normal values within 3 to 12 months of continued lorcainide therapy. Low serum Na+ and hypoosmolality in the absence of volume depletion, clinically manifest edema, and unaltered renal, adrenal, cardiac, or thyroid function suggest that this antiarrhythmic drug produced the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). SIADH appeared to be transient and asymptomatic in our patients. One patient developed severe hyponatremia with serum Na+ of 108 mEq/L when hydrochlorothiazide was given to control hypertension. It is concluded that SIADH is an important side effect of lorcainide therapy. We recommend that serum Na+ be carefully monitored in patients started on lorcainide therapy, and extreme caution should be exercised in prescribing diuretics to patients with persistent hyponatremia.",1984,12
1228,6510223,Chlorpropamide-induced hemolytic anemia.,"Acute intravascular hemolysis developed when a diabetic patient, previously treated with glyburide, was started on another oral sulfonylurea drug, chlorpropamide. Immunoglobulins were not found in the patient's serum and the red cells were coated with C3 only, suggesting an ""innocent bystander"" reaction. This case demonstrates that there is no cross reactivity between glyburide and chlorpropamide in producing hemolytic anemia.",1984,12
1229,6519218,Interstitial pneumopathy and low-dosage amiodarone.,"In a 61-year-old man receiving chronic low-dosage amiodarone an interstitial pneumopathy was observed. In the absence of other causes, we suspected an adverse reaction to amiodarone, not least because of the similarity with histologic findings of cases previously reported. Drug withdrawal and cortisone administration led to resolution of the disease.",1984,11
1230,6529939,Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial block induced by propranolol.,"Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial (S-A) block was observed in a 57-year-old woman, under treatment for angina with 80 mg propranolol daily. The electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short P-P intervals and occasional pauses. These pauses were always preceded by the short P-P intervals and were usually followed by one or two P-P intervals of 0.92-0.95 s representing the basic sinus cycle. Following these basic sinus cycles, alternating rhythm started with the longer P-P interval. The long P-P intervals ranged between 1.04-1.12 s and the short P-P intervals between 0.80-0.84 s, respectively. The duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long P-P interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle. In one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2/1 S-A block was observed. This short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the P-P interval starting the alternative rhythm. There were small changes in the shape of the P waves and P-R intervals. S-A conduction through two pathways, the first with 2/1 block the second having 0.12-0.14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2/1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating P-P interval and other electrocardiographic features seen. Atropine 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all P-P intervals without changing the rhythm. The abnormal rhythm disappeared with the withdrawal of propranolol and when the drug was restarted a 2/1 S-A block was seen. This was accepted as evidence for propranolol being the cause of this conduction disorder.",1984,11
1231,6540393,Anaphylactoid reaction to methylprednisolone pulsed therapy for multiple sclerosis.,"A further case of anaphylactoid reaction to methylprednisolone is reported. The occurrence of allergic reactions to steroids is reviewed, and suggestions for management of pulsed IV methylprednisolone therapy are made.",1984,8
1232,6572542,Pulmonary fibrosis subsequent to high doses of CCNU for chronic myeloid leukemia.,"Two patients treated for chronic myeloid leukemia with high doses of CCNU (1100 mg/m2 and 1240 mg/m2, respectively) developed a fatal pulmonary fibrosis. This side effect has never been reported for this nitrosourea but only for BCNU and methyl-CCNU. The responsibility of CCNU in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis seems very likely. The possibility that the underlying disease or other chemotherapeutic agents may increase the risk of pulmonary toxicity can, however, be discussed. In addition, 13 other adults treated for chronic myeloid leukemia with various doses of CCNU were reviewed. No respiratory symptoms appeared in the ten patients who were given less than 950 mg/m2. Three patients who received more than 1100 mg/m2 developed pulmonary symptoms with the same clinical and radiologic pattern as in the two cases with pathologic documents, and two of them died from acute respiratory failure. Although lung specimens were lacking from these three patients, it is suggested that the pulmonary toxicity of CCNU may be dose-related.",1983,5
1233,6578007,Additive pulmonary toxicity with melphalan and busulfan therapy.,"We report a 59-year-old patient with chronic myeloid leukemia, who developed severe interstitial lung fibrosis after short term and sequential treatment with melphalan and busulfan. The probable additive toxicity of both agents on the pulmonary tissue is discussed.",1983,10
1234,6597713,Cholestyramine induced hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.,"The first reported case, in an adult, of cholestyramine induced hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is a 70 year old female with a two year history of primary biliary cirrhosis confirmed by histologic and immunologic criteria. After taking cholestyramine II sachets twice daily for two months she presented with lethargy, confusion and drowsiness. Examination revealed confusion, jaundice, signs of chronic liver disease, portal hypertension and hepatic encephalopathy. Laboratory investigations confirmed a metabolic acidosis (pH 7.15) and hyperchloremia. Multiple cultures failed to reveal sepsis and a urinary pH of 4.85 together with tests of renal acidification, excluded renal tubular acidosis. She received 600 mEq of sodium bicarbonate intravenously over 36 hours by which time her mentation, electrolytes and pH were normal. It is presumed that her hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis was secondary to cholestyramine because of the similarity to pediatric reports; the rapid and lasting response to intravenous sodium bicarbonate; the absence of another etiology; normal serum potassium, chloride and bicarbonate despite continued spironolactone therapy after recovery.",1984,10
1235,6608139,Effectiveness of pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin) in refractory lymphoid neoplasms.,"Pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin, DCF) was administered to 17 patients with a variety of lymphoid neoplasms, both T- and B-cell, that were refractory to conventional treatments. Several responses and 2 complete remissions occurred. Toxic effects were less severe than previously described: this may be attributable to relatively low doses of DCF or to precautions taken to prevent tumour lysis syndrome. DCF appears valuable as a second-line treatment in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and as initial treatment in T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mycosis fungoides. Although myelosuppression is mild, immunosuppression and superinfection are potential hazards of treatment with DCF. The ocular toxicity of DCF, previously described as conjunctivitis, appears to be a keratitis of moderate severity which requires further study.",1984,2
1236,6610943,Myoglobinuria and acute renal failure associated with intravenous vasopressin infusion.,"Myoglobinuria and acute renal failure were observed in two patients with vasopressin-treated gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Because there were no other obvious causes of renal failure in either patient, we propose that skeletal muscle ischemia developed during vasopressin infusion, followed by release of myoglobin and renal damage. This association should be considered in the period after vasopressin-treated gastrointestinal hemorrhage.",1984,7
1237,6614033,Amphotericin B nephrotoxicity in humans decreased by salt repletion.,"A major limitation in the use of amphotericin B is its potential to cause nephrotoxicity. In animals, increased dietary sodium reduces renal toxicity. Experience with five patients in whom impaired renal function developed early during amphotericin B therapy is reported. In four of the patients, there was evidence of sodium depletion due to low sodium intake, diuretic administration, or vomiting. In all five patients, sodium loading was associated with improved renal function, which permitted amphotericin B therapy to be continued in fully effective doses to the completion of elective courses of treatment without evidence of residual impaired renal function. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that intrarenal regulatory mechanisms contribute to changes in renal function due to amphotericin B therapy.",1983,9
1238,6618859,"Gynecomastia in epileptics treated with phenobarbital, phenytoin and fluoresone: two case reports.","Gynecomastia developed in two epileptic patients some months after the addition of oral fluoresone 750 mg daily to the phenobarbital and phenytoin already being administered. The common systemic diseases that may give rise to gynecomastia were excluded. One of the patients presented hyperprolactinemia and a raised estrogen/androgen ratio but the hormone levels were not raised in the other. The onset of symptoms after fluorescence in both cases is highly suggestive, although the pathogenetic mechanism is not clear.",1983,6

Occurrence of withdrawal dyskinesia indicates that the neuroleptic effects of amoxapine may be clinically significant.",1983,11
1240,6628806,Toxic hepatitis due to combination therapy with methotrexate and etretinate in psoriasis.,A case of toxic hepatitis caused by combination therapy with methotrexate and etretinate in the treatment of severe psoriasis is presented in a 47-year-old woman. The patient had received methotrexate alone for more than 10 years without any signs of severe liver damage. The liver status had been controlled by consecutive liver biopsies. The treatment was discontinued and after 2 months the liver parameters became normal.,1983,0
1241,6635723,Thiazide-induced hyponatremia.,"A 54-year-old woman had seizures and a focal neurologic deficit associated with hyponatremia induced by a thiazide diuretic. Prompt correction of hyponatremia by administration of hypertonic saline solution was followed by resolution of all neurologic defects. Metabolic balance studies and rechallenge with hydrochlorothiazide were undertaken to investigate the mechanism of the thiazide-induced hyponatremia. Abnormal vasopressin secretion was shown by a plasma vasopressin concentration of 0.5 microU/ml with a plasma osmolality of 268 mOsm/kg water after administration of a fluid challenge consisting of 45 ml/kg body weight. Rechallenge with chlorothiazide while on a sodium- and potassium-controlled balanced diet resulted in a decrease in serum sodium concentration (136 to 124 mEq/L) and plasma osmolality (283 to 261 mOsm/kg) within 18 hours. During this period, urine losses of monovalent cation were only 55 mEq and body weight was constant at 48.2 kg. A second challenge while the patient received all fluids and electrolytes intravenously again resulted in decreased serum sodium concentration (134 to 126 mEq/L) after urinary loss of only 69 mEq of cation. Thus this patient's hyponatremia cannot be accounted for solely by changes in external water and electrolyte balance; the rapidity with which changes were produced suggests that osmolar inactivation, probably intracellularly, may contribute to the severe hypotonicity seen in some patients.",1983,11
1242,6651138,Transdermal scopolamine delivery system (TRANSDERM-V) and acute angle-closure glaucoma.,A 58-year-old woman developed unilateral acute angle-closure glaucoma four days after the application of a patch of transdermal scopolamine delivery system (TRANSDERM-V).,1983,11
1243,665845,Tardive dyskinesia in an adolescent.,"The frequent use of neuroleptic drugs in the treatment of disturbed children and adolescents demands that clinicians be aware of the danger of tardive dyskinesia in this age group. A case history of a 15-year-old boy who developed incapacitating tardive dyskinesia that resolved during treatment with deanol is presented. The recognition, differential diagnosis, and management of this syndrome in children are discussed. Lithium carbonate was a useful alternative to neuroleptics in managing the adolescent's disturbed behavior.",1978,8
1244,6671350,Coagulopathy associated with the use of cephalosporin or moxalactam antibiotics in acute and chronic renal failure.,"Nine azotemic patients who developed a coagulopathy associated with the use of either cephalosporin or moxalactam antibiotics are reported. The acute renal failure patients had neoplastic disorders and were considered to be septic at the time that multiple antibiotics were administered. Four of 5 chronic hemo- or peritoneal dialysis patients also received multiple antibiotics. Nevertheless, the coagulopathy seemed to be most closely associated with the administration of the cephalosporin. One patient received moxalactam as part of the combination therapy for diffuse pulmonary infiltration during renal transplant rejection. Bleeding occurred into the gastrointestinal tract in four patients, into the kidney-urinary tract in three patients, into vascular surgical sites in two patients, and one each into the pulmonary-bronchial and cerebral-ventricular systems. Five operations were performed in four patients: a nephrectomy for massive subcapsular hemorrhage with a prothrombin time that exceeded 100 seconds; arteriovenous graft complicated by post-operative bleeding associated with prolongation of the prothrombin time; elective femoral-popliteal bypass complicated by a prolonged prothrombin time, bleeding into the graft site, hypotension, and a subendocardial myocardial infarction; elective cholecystectomy complicated by a two unit bleed associated with a slightly prolonged prothrombin time, followed by elective femoral-popliteal bypass complicated by a fatal intercerebral bleed associated with a more than twice normal prothrombin time. Cephalosporins are most likely associated with Vitamin K deficiency. Moxalactam is more likely to be associated with platelet dysfunction. Monitoring of the prothrombin time for cephalosporins or the bleeding time for moxalactam is the most reliable way to prevent what may be rapid emergence of clinical bleeding in patients with renal failure.",1983,0

1246,6683487,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura during penicillamine therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) developed in a patient with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after 2 1/2 months of treatment with penicillamine. After discontinuation of the drug, plasmapheresis and steroid therapy led to a sustained remission. To our knowledge, no prior cases of penicillamine-induced TTP in RA have been reported.",1983,7
1247,6692713,Possible recurrence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity following corticosteroid therapy.,"Amiodarone hydrochloride, a new antiarrhythmic agent, has been associated with pulmonary toxicity characterized by cough, dyspnea and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. We describe a case of fibrosing alveolitis, diagnosed by lung biopsy, in a patient receiving amiodarone which responded to corticosteroid therapy. The pulmonary symptoms recurred after discontinuing corticosteroids, five months after amiodarone was stopped, and were associated with a persistent amiodarone level. To our knowledge, this recurrence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity has not been reported previously.",1984,2
1248,6693840,Gynecomastia associated with theophylline.,A 61 year-old male patient developed gynecomastia after starting theophylline. The gynecomastia regressed when the theophylline was discontinued. No other endogenous or exogenous cause for the gynecomastia could be found except for the theophylline.,1984,1
1249,6697887,Parenteral-verapamil-induced sustained hypotension.,"The incidence of oral-verapamil-induced hypotension in the presence of concomitant beta-adrenergic blockade by the oral route is quite rare. The major contraindication to the use of intravenous verapamil is recent administration of intravenous beta-blocking agents (i.e., within the past two hours). We report a case of sustained hypotension after administration of parenteral verapamil. Vasopressors were required to support blood pressure for approximately five hours. The patient had been on oral propranolol for the past five years and had taken his last dose of propranolol approximately ten hours before the administration of parenteral verapamil for treatment of a supraventricular tachycardia documented by an electrocardiogram.",1984,3
1250,6702890,Pure red cell aplasia associated with fenoprofen.,A 69-year-old man developed pure red cell aplasia after taking fenoprofen for ten months. The erythroid defect fully reversed after the drug was discontinued and could not be attributed to the patient's previously treated lung carcinoma. This case represents the third example of erythroid aplasia associated with an anti-inflammatory agent and the first instance due to fenoprofen.,0,0
1251,6721543,Antimalarial psychosis revisited.,"Drug-induced psychosis resulted from the administration of quinacrine hydrochloride at a dosage of 100 mg twice daily for the treatment of discoid lupus. After two weeks of drug treatment, the patient exhibited symptoms similar to those seen in the manic phase of bipolar affective disorder. Although the incidence of antimalarial psychosis is unclear and perhaps small, we recommend close observation of patients for behavioral changes suggesting the development of antimalarial psychosis. Astute observation, leading to the early detection of behavioral changes, may help avert the development of a costly and disabling complication of drug therapy.",1984,6
1252,6725214,Priapism associated with trazodone therapy: case report.,"A case of priapism associated with trazodone is described. Erection subsided spontaneously after 4 hours, with subsequent potency unimpaired. No published reports of priapism with antidepressants were located, but 11 cases have been reported to the manufacturers.",1984,5
1253,672731,The treatment of paracetamol overdose with charcoal haemoperfusion and cysteamine.,"A 53-year-old female was admitted to hospital one hour after taking an overdose of 60 g of paracetamol and 960 mg of codeine. Two hours after ingestion of the drug, the plasma concentration of paracetamol was 3040 mumol/l. In view of the enormous, and potentially fatal, plasma concentration of the drug, charcoal haemoperfusion was undertaken as well as cysteamine therapy. Charcoal haemoperfusion and cysteamine therapy led to the rapid removal of the paracetamol from the body and consequently prevented the development of severe hepatic necrosis. It is suggested that charcoal haemoperfusion as well as cysteamine has a role in the management of severe overdosage with paracetamol. This is the first report on the use of charcoal haemoperfusion for acute poisoning in Australia.",1978,4
1254,6731466,Focal renal cortical necrosis associated with zomepirac.,"Anaphylactoid shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and anuric renal failure requiring dialysis occurred in a patient receiving zomepirac sodium for toothache. Although renal function showed gradual improvement after seven days of anuria, the recovery was slow and incomplete. Renal biopsy three weeks after the onset of renal failure revealed evidence of focal renal cortical necrosis. Association of zomepirac administration with renal cortical necrosis is not known to have been previously demonstrated. This observation adds another dimension to the previously reported renal complications of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, especially zomepirac. The proportions of lymphocyte subsets, as defined with monoclonal antibodies, and the proliferative response to mitogens were normal. The patient's lymphocytes showed no proliferative response to zomepirac. Serum complement components and immunoglobulin levels were within normal limits, and radioallergosorbent testing gave negative results. The mechanism of anaphylactoid reaction to zomepirac in this case, therefore, remains unclear.",1984,6
1255,6733633,Cimetidine-induced fever.,Cimetidine is a rare cause of drug-induced fever. In a patient without evidence of hypersensitivity (the lymphocytes did not react to the drug in vitro) fever was the sole manifestation of an adverse reaction to cimetidine that was confirmed by challenge with the drug.,1984,6
1256,6738830,Unique behavioral change with cinepazide in parkinsonism. A case report.,"A 56-year-old male parkinsonian patient developed a unique behavioral change following the oral administration of cinepazide, a cerebral vasodilator. This behavior consisted of an apparent infatuation with a ward nurse, which ceased after medication was discontinued.",1984,0
1257,6744146,Amphojeloma: antacid impaction in a critically ill patient.,"Patients in the intensive care unit seldom have mechanical small-bowel obstruction, and obstruction due to medication bezoars is even less common. A 65-year-old woman, in the intensive care unit because of septic shock and acute renal failure, had a small-bowel obstruction due to Amphojel concretions. Obstruction from such a cause may be prevented by including non-constipating antacids, stool softeners or sorbitol. Aggressive use of H2-antagonists to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding in septic patients will reduce the need for orally administered antacids. When obstruction occurs due to antacid concretions, it may be relieved by passing a long intestinal tube, by giving enemas for colonic obstruction or by operation.",1984,7
1258,6766717,Periodic alternating nystagmus in phenytoin intoxication.,"A patient with alcoholic cerebellar degeneration had periodic alternating nystagmus during a period of phenytoin intoxication. The nystagmus resolved as the serum phenytoin level fell, as demonstrated by electronystagmography. Periodic alternating nystagmus generally implies structural brainstem disease, especially at the craniocervical junction. To our knowledge, its drug-related occurrence has not been previously reported.",1980,3
1259,6788011,"Gold nephropathy. Ultrastructural, fluorescent, and energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis study.","The nephrotic syndrome developed in a patient receiving therapy with gold for rheumatoid arthritis. The results of a histopathological examination of the renal biopsy specimen were unremarkable. Immunofluorescent studies showed deposits of immunoglobulins and C3 in a granular pattern in the glomerular basement membranes. Ultrastructurally, the discrete osmiophilic immune complexes were epimembranous. By x-ray microanalysis, gold that was complexed with sulfur was present in proximal tubular cytoplasmic vacuoles and nuclei. Gold and sulfur could not be demonstrated in glomerular epimembranous deposits. The results of these studies suggest that immune complex deposition does not involve gold and sulfur acting as haptens. Gold-salt therapy may result in damage to proximal tubules that leak renal tubular antigens, which in turn complex with autoantibody and produce an autoimmune membranous nephropathy. The evidence for this mechanism is not convincing. Although the data indicate an immune-complex cause for gold-salt nephropathy, the incident antigen (or antigens) and mechanism of action remain unidentified.",1981,7
1260,6794018,Intrahepatic cholestasis and cutaneous bullae associated with glibenclamide therapy.,"Intrahepatic cholestasis and cutaneous bullae associated with glibenclamide therapy are described in a 61-year-old diabetic patient who presented wit hypoglycaemic coma. These features have not previously been reported as side effects of glibenclamide therapy, but intrahepatic cholestasis may occur with chlorpropamide, a similar sulphonylurea agent. The mechanism of this cholestasis is not clear at present.",1981,4
1261,6797753,Action of intracoronary nitroglycerin in refractory coronary artery spasm.,"Coronary artery spasm usually responds to sublingual nitroglycerin. This report describes four patients with variant angina and one patient with rest angina who had coronary spasm that was refractory to sublingual or i.v. nitroglycerin. In four patients, spasm occurred spontaneous and in one patient after 0.05 mg of ergonovine. In each case, 25-100 micrograms of intracoronary nitroglycerin promptly (30-45 seconds) resulted in reopacification of the vessel involved in spasm and resolution of evidence for ischemia. Thus, intracoronary nitroglycerin can reverse coronary artery spasm that does not respond to systemic nitroglycerin administration.",1982,2
1262,6810714,Adverse effects of combined propranolol and chlorpromazine therapy.,"The authors describe a woman with chronic schizophrenia who experienced delirium, grand mal seizure, and photosensitivity after the addition of propranolol to her neuroleptic regimen. The pharmacokinetic synergism of this combination may be hazardous for some patients.",1982,9
1263,681921,Catatonia associated with disulfiram therapy.,"This is the first report of a catatonic syndrome occurring in a patient receiving disulfiram treatment. A causal relationship is strongly suggested by the mode of onset, the absence of a previous history of catatonia, and the rapid resolution of the syndrome within 72 hours of discontinuance of the disulfiram therapy. Neurophysiological mechanisms which aid in elucidating the role of disulfiram in the etiology of catatonia are discussed. It is important that physicians be alerted to this serious, potentially lethal, complication, as it is readily reversible if the disulfiram is discontinued and appropriate supportive measures are taken. Also, it appears that these patients may be more susceptible to complications with future disulfiram usage and should be strongly counseled to seek alternative therapies for their alcohol problems in the future.",1978,8
1264,6826112,Hepatic reactions to cyclofenil.,"Thirty patients with hepatic reactions to cyclofenil, a non-steroidal drug with a stimulating effect on ovulation, are reviewed. The liver damage was probably related to metabolic idiosyncrasy, and was reversible in all patients.",1983,3
1265,6830388,A fatal case of theophylline intoxication.,"A fatal case of theophylline intoxication is presented in which a number of factors leading to a decrease in theophylline clearance and the patient's death were possibly operative. These included advanced age, chronic lung disease, liver disease, and administration of cimetidine. Since early symptoms of the toxic effects of theophylline can mimic peptic ulcer disease, cimetidine might be prescribed for the gastrointestinal symptoms with subsequent worsening of theophylline poisoning. Theophylline plasma concentration should be determined whenever drugs affecting theophylline clearance are administered simultaneously.",1983,3
1266,6833205,Desipramine-associated SIADH in an elderly woman: case report.,"The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) has numerous etiologies, including medical illness, stress, and various pharmacologic agents. While a number of psychotropic agents may induce SIADH, only a few reports of tricyclic-antidepressant-induced SIADH exist. A case of SIADH associated with desipramine treatment in an elderly depressed woman is described.",1983,4
1267,6837655,Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis during antituberculous therapy.,"Within 3 weeks of beginning continuous daily isoniazid and rifampin therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis, a patient developed acute renal failure. Renal biopsy demonstrated lesions characteristic of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with minor interstitial changes. Prior reports have emphasized the tubular and interstitial lesions associated with intermittent or discontinuous rifampin therapy for tuberculosis. This report documents the occurrence of severe glomerular pathology associated with continuous, daily antituberculous therapy. The spectrum of renal lesions occurring during antituberculous therapy, particularly in association with rifampin, may be wider than previously suspected.",0,0
1268,6851259,Nephrotic range pseudoproteinuria in a tolmetin-treated patient.,"False-positive proteinuria by acid precipitation testing in tolmetin-treated patients has been noted on routine urinalysis screening. However, the magnitude of such false positivity has not been previously reported. We present a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus who presented with nephrotic range pseudoproteinuria using an acid precipitation method of testing. This misleading laboratory result and alternative methods of testing for proteinuria in tolmetin-treated patients are discussed.",1983,4
1269,6854698,Histamine poisoning on ingestion of tuna fish.,When tuberculosis patients on isoniazid eat certain varieties of fish they may develop a histamine reaction. The occurrence of this reaction in a mother and daughter on ingestion of tuna fish is reported. Two other members of the family who were on treatment for tuberculosis but had not taken isoniazid on the day of the episode were unaffected by the same meal.,1983,2
1270,6860059,Fulminant hepatitis associated with disulfiram. Report of a case.,"Disulfiram is used commonly as reinforcement in the treatment of chronic alcoholism. Although the drug is generally considered safe, there are reports of side effects including psychosis and hepatitis. We report a case of fatal fulminant hepatitis caused by the use of disulfiram in a man with previously normal hepatocellular function.",1983,6
1271,6865827,Recurrent agranulocytosis induced by two different antithyroid agents.,"A 45-year-old woman with thyrotoxicosis developed agranulocytosis after treatment with propylthiouracil. When the thyrotoxicosis recurred, accompanied by a severe psychotic reaction, administration of antithyroid medication was recommenced. The patient was given methimazole instead of propylthiouracil but, 10 weeks later, agranulocytosis again occurred. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of a case in which agranulocytosis followed treatment with both propylthiouracil and methimazole in the same patient.",1983,7
1272,6873616,Intrahepatic cholestasis and sicca complex after thiabendazole. Report of a case and review of the literature.,"Thiabendazole is a relatively safe and effective agent with a wide range of activity against nematodes infesting the gastrointestinal tract. A 55-yr-old man developed prolonged jaundice and sicca complex after a course of thiabendazole therapy. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography demonstrated normal biliary tree and pancreatic ducts. Liver biopsy was consistent with a drug-induced intrahepatic cholestatic reaction. The patient recovered completely from his liver injury, but the sicca complex persisted 1 yr after the drug was given. The literature on thiabendazole-induced cholestasis and its association with sicca complex is reviewed.",1983,9
1273,6928097,The surgical resection and chemotherapy of metastatic osteogenic sarcoma of the right ventricle.,"The case report of a patient with metastatic osteogenic sarcoma of the right ventricle who had had an interscapulothoracic amputation in October, 1970, and a left lower lobectomy in June, 1973, for pulmonary metastasis is presented. The patient was hospitalized in October, 1974, with signs and symptoms of right ventricular outflow obstruction and arrhythmia, and cardiac workup established the presence of a right ventricular tumor. The lesion was successfully resected using cardiopulmonary bypass, and the diagnosis of metastatic osteogenic sarcoma was confirmed. The patient did well after the operation and returned to normal activity. She was placed on adjuvant Adriamycin (doxorubicin) chemotherapy, but 6 months later died of Adriamycin toxicity.",1980,1
1274,6933231,Intracranial hemorrhage and focal seizures secondary to use of L-asparaginase during induction therapy of acute lymphocytic leukemia.,"L-Asparaginase is commonly used for induction therapy of acute lymphocytic leukemia of childhood. Severe clinical bleeding secondary to clotting dysfunction has not been previously reported. We observed intracranial hemorrhagic infarcts with focal seizures and hemiparesis associated with clotting abnormalities, including severe hypofibrinogenemia, probably the result of L-asparaginase administered during induction therapy of acute lymphocytic leukemia.",1980,11
1275,6947095,Dural sinus thrombosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Dural sinus thrombosis developed in two children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during induction treatment with vincristine sulfate, prednisone, and asparaginase. Headache, nausea, emesis, and lethargy were the presenting signs. The diagnosis was confirmed by arteriography. The cause is presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulability due to asparaginase-induced antithrombin III deficiency. The patients received anticoagulation therapy and recovered completely. Only two of the six reported patients without heparinization survived.",1981,12
1276,6958210,Systemic lupus erythematosus during penicillamine therapy for rheumatoid arthritis.,"Six patients with rheumatoid arthritis developed a syndrome resembling lupus erythematosus while being treated with penicillamine. All patients had previous mucocutaneous reactions to chrysotherapy. Manifestations included pleurisy in five of six patients, rashes in three, nephritis in two, and neurologic disturbances in two; lupus erythematosus cells were found in five patients, antinuclear antibodies in all six, antideoxyribonucleic acid in three, positive Coombs' test results for three patients, and low C4 complement in five of the six. Symptoms were slow to resolve after penicillamine treatment was discontinued, and four of the patients needed corticosteroid therapy. A higher frequency than expected of HLA A 11 in three patients and B 15 in five patients was seen.",1982,11
1277,6987607,"Familial, dexamethasone-suppressible, normokalemic hyperaldosteronism.","An 8-year-old boy was found to be hypertensive on routine exam (144/88). His brother (age 6) and father (age 31) were also found to have elevated blood pressure. Detailed investigations first revealed a low renin level without hypokalemia. Further study revealed that all three patients had low plasma renin activity and nonsuppresible plasma aldosterone levels after saline infusion. Serum potassium was almost always normal. A trial of dexamethasone therapy normalized blood pressure, and plasma and urinary aldosterone decreased to low levels and renin levels increased. Therapy with spironolactone and prednisone also normalized blood pressure. However, the amount of prednisone required to maintain normotension resulted in Cushingoid features and has been discontinued. Studies in the father suggest that the aldosterone production by his adrenals is hyperresponsive to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Renin levels should be determined in all hypertensive children and their hypertensive parents. If renin is low and plasma aldosterone fails to be suppressed by saline infusion, a trial of dexamethasone would seem indicated before other investigations are carried out.",1980,3
1278,6998294,Disopyramide (Norpace)-induced hypoglycemia.,"Disopyramide (Norpace) is a recently released antiarrhythmic agent with quinidine-like actions, but structurally unique. We describe a patient in whom impressive hypoglycemia developed following treatment with this agent. Blood glucose levels returned to normal after cessation of therapy, but dropped again following rechallenge with the drug. The pathogenesis of the hypoglycemia was investigated by assessment of serum insulin, plasma glucagon and serum alanine levels during disopyramide rechallenge. Clinicians should be aware of fasting hypoglycemia as an unusual but potentially serious complication of disopyramide therapy.",1980,9
1279,7019786,Cefoxitin-associated renal failure.,Two elderly women suffered an acute deterioration of renal function after treatment with cefoxitin sodium. One with stable chronic renal failure due to reflux nephropathy underwent a rapid deterioration of renal function which proved fatal. The other woman had rheumatoid arthritis and developed acute tubular necrosis after treatment with gentamicin and cefoxitin. All the data suggested that the antibiotic was responsible for the deterioration in renal function. The dose of cefoxitin should be reduced in patients with renal functional impairment. Cefoxitin should either be used with great caution or not prescribed in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics.,1981,5
1280,7035691,Transient anuria following administration of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 14225) in a patient with renal artery stenosis of the solitary kidney successfully treated with renal autotransplantation.,"We report on a patient with renal artery stenosis who had only 1 kidney and in whom acute renal impairment developed with transient anuria after the administration of captopril. Although inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme is considered to be efficient treatment for hypertension associated with chronic renal failure, care should be taken when captopril is administered initially to a patient with decreased renal function, under the conditions of sodium and water depletion. The renovascular hypertension in this patient was treated successfully by renal autotransplantation.",1982,1
1281,7056119,Atypical ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes) induced by amiodarone: arrhythmia previously induced by quinidine and disopyramide.,"A 44-year-old woman is described in whom amiodarone, disopyramide, and quinidine, administered alone separately, induced atypical ventricular tachycardia (AVT, torsade de pointes). Following a closed mitral valvotomy, she received quinidine, 1.2 g/day, without interruption for 17 years. Because of a recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the dose of the drug was increased to 1.4 g/day; 24 hours later AVT with syncope developed but responded promptly to atropine. Two years later, 24 hours following an increase in the dose of disopyramide from 300 to 600 mg/day, AVT with syncope occurred; isoproterenol abolished the arrhythmia instantly. Amiodarone was the third drug to induce AVT in this patient; she received 200 mg/day six days per week for six months. The dose was subsequently increased to 200 and 400 mg/day on alternate days, six days per week, and two months later AVT occurred. That time the only effective treatment was ventricular pacing.",1982,3
1282,7067510,Acute and transient ST segment elevation during bacterial shock in seven patients without apparent heart disease.,"Acute elevation of the ST segment in several ECG leads was observed in seven patients with bacterial shock during the course of therapy. Six patients had bacterial pneumonia, one had acute cholecystitis, and none had a previous history of heart disease. At the onset of the ST elevation, all patients were receiving dopamine infusion, which in four of them was inadvertently increased shortly before the ECG changes, the ST elevation was not associated with chest pain, pericardial friction rub, or acute changes in the heart rate, or arterial blood pressure. In four patients the maximum ST elevation was greater than or equal to 5 mm. In each instance the ST segment returned to the isoelectric line within 24 hours, and subsequent development of Q waves or changes in the QRS was not observed. Although the existence of an acute pericarditis or an acute myocarditis as possible causes of the ST elevation cannot be fully ruled out, the sudden onset, prominent magnitude, and brief duration of the ST elevation are perhaps more indicative of an acute ischemic event, possibly related to a transient coronary vasoconstriction induced by the dopamine infusion.",1982,4
1283,7071645,Membranous nephropathy in rheumatoid arthritis.,"We have described a man with classic rheumatoid arthritis who had membranous nephropathy associated with nephrotic syndrome not related to gold or penicillamine therapy. Complete remission of the nephrosis occurred after discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine therapy. Further study is needed to determine the incidence of subclinical membranous nephropathy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the effect of drugs in triggering clinical manifestations of this condition.",1982,4
1284,7081289,Hepatitis following cimetidine administration.,There have been only two reports of cimetidine-induced hepatitis. Such a low incidence suggests a hypersensitivity type of reaction.

1285,7098384,Suicidal digoxin poisoning: conventional treatment and antibody therapy.,"A 66-year-old mand suffering from severe coronary heart disease took digoxin with suicidal intent an was treated for the ensuing complete atrioventricular block with digoxin-specific antibody fragments. Two and a half hours after intravenous infusion of the antibody fragments, the signs of intoxication passed off, and atrial fibrillation with a normal ventricular rate was reinstated. Antibody therapy is capable of permanently abolishing the signs of symptoms of digitalis poisoning after a matter of hours. Such a rapid or complete response cannot be achieved by any conventional form of treatment. This advantage must be weighed against the risks (immunologic reactions, loss of the therapeutic effect of the cardiac glycoside if an overdose of antibody is given). Moreover, antibody therapy does not take effect immediately, as is understandable in view of the mechanism of action. It should therefore be instituted in good time in potentially life-threatening cases of intoxication.",1982,4
1286,7105508,Verapamil in effort-induced angina pectoris in patients with normal coronary arteries.,"Two patients with classical effort-induced angina pectoris associated with abnormal ST-segment depression on graded exercise testing and normal coronary arteriograms are described. Both patients deteriorated during treatment with propranolol, and became asymptomatic during treatment with verapamil with normal graded exercise tests. Verapamil may thus improve an inadequate vasodilatatory response of the coronary vascular bed to effort.",1982,6
1287,7117795,Ulcerating enteritis associated with flucytosine therapy.,"Flucytosine-associated diarrhea has been previously described in 6%-10% of patients receiving the drug. A potentially fatal ulcerating enterocolitis has been reported in 4 patients. In none of these reports has radiologic or pathologic data been presented. This report describes a case of flucytosine-associated ulcerating enteritis in which the small bowel x-ray demonstrated severe luminal narrowing, ulceration, and marked separation of loops of bowel. Ileal biopsy revealed an erosive enteritis with mucosal inflammatory infiltrate and disruption of the surface epithelium. Discontinuation of the drug resulted in total resolution of the clinical and radiologic abnormalities.",1982,11

Long-term complication of L-asparaginase treatment.,L-asparaginase-induced pancreatitis has been reported during or closely following administration of the drug. Three cases of pseudocyst of the pancreas in two women and one man have previously been reported with the use of intravenous L-asparaginase. An adolescent male developed acute pancreatitis and pseudocyst of the pancreas 16 weeks after cessation of intramuscular L-asparaginase. Delayed pseudocyst of the pancreas can be a complication of intramuscular L-asparaginase.,1982,12
1290,7151655,Treatment of severe lactic acidosis with dichloroacetate.,"Four patients with severe lactic acidosis associated with septic shock were treated with sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) (50 mg/kg body wt), an activator of pyruvate dehydrogenase. All patients were in a group with an expected mortality rate of 90-100%, based on previous studies. In one patient, treatment with DCA was associated with a decrease in blood lactate levels from 11.2 mM before treatment to 0.8 mM 16 h later. Markedly elevated blood pyruvate and alanine levels also decreased to normal. After treatment, the arterial blood pH rose to 7.53, and vasopressor agents were no longer needed to support blood pressure. Some degree of biochemical improvement was also noted in the other cases in whom the blood lactate levels before treatment were 15, 17, and 31 mM. However, all three patients eventually died of refractory acidosis.",0,0
1291,7174620,The course of delirium due to lithium intoxication.,"Nine delirious patients suffering from lithium intoxication were examined with the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMS) to describe the clinical course of the disorder. Serial serum lithium levels were also obtained. Serum lithium levels fell rapidly, but the cognitive impairment associated with the delirium typically persisted for another week or two. Late-developing but self-limiting neuropsychiatric complications occurred in four patients. The basis of the temporal dissociation of serum lithium levels from the clinical manifestations of lithium intoxication remains uncertain.",1982,11
1292,717931,Life-threatening hyperkalemia induced by arginine.,"Marked hyperkalemia was observed during and immediately after an infusion of arginine monohydrochloride in two patients with severe hepatic disease and moderate renal insufficiency. Both patients had received brief courses of spironolactone before arginine treatment. In one of the patients, the hyperkalemia was associated with a fatal cardiac arrhythmia. Arginine has been shown to shift potassium from cells to the extracellular compartment, an effect directly related to its serum concentration. The profound hyperkalemia that occurred in these two patients is thought to be the result of an inability to metabolize the administered arginine and excrete the excess extracellular potassium. Caution is advised in administering arginine to patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency, or both.",1978,11
1293,71813,Lichen planus and acne provoked by gold.,"A 58-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis developed lichen planus during treatment with gold. Four months after cessation of treatment, a severe acne with comedones, papules, pustules, and small cystic elements broke out. No connection could be demonstrated between the eruption and other drugs or chemicals. Acne provoked by gold seems not to have been described elsewhere. The case history confirms that gold treatment, even in the same patient, can give rise to a wide range of skin disturbances, which in many cases do not break out until long after the drug has been withdrawn.",1977,0
1294,7212107,Lithium's effect of parathyroid hormone.,"Lithium has been reported to raise serum calcium and lower serum phosphate concentrations and to increase urinary calcium excretion. Because these changes may be effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH was measured in 19 patients receiving lithium. PTH was significantly higher in these patients than in 150 normal subjects. For all patients serum calcium concentrations correlated significantly with serum lithium concentrations. These results indicate that lithium may cause biochemical hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism in certain patients with lithium nephrotoxicity is also possible.",1981,4
1295,7226916,Disopyramide-induced heart block.,"A 57-year-old woman with right bundle branch block +LPH and ventricular premature contractions developed complete heart block (CHB) following administration of disopyramide phosphate (Norpace). The ECG at the onset of CHB suggested block to have occurred in the trifascicular conduction system. On rechallenging the patient with the drug following the implantation of a permanent pacemaker, intermittent complete heart block developed. This case suggests that disopyramide should be used with caution in patients with bifascicular block patterns on ECG.",1981,4
1296,7235792,Paradoxical ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation after intravenous bretylium therapy. Report of two cases.,"Two patients were treated with bretylium tosylate for malignant ventricular arrhythmias after inadequate response to conventional agents. In the first patient, two episodes of ventricular tachycardia requiring cardioversion occurred in close temporal sequence with administering bretylium. With drug rechallenge two days later, ventricular tachycardia recurred within minutes. In the second case, five cardiac arrests due to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation occurred during several hours after beginning a trial of bretylium maintenance therapy for complex ventricular ectopy. Although transient increases in ectopy after bretylium therapy have been described, presumably due to catecholamine release, the occurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia leading to cardiac arrest has not previously been emphasized. There is potential for this side effect, and additional caution in the use of this drug should be followed.",1981,5
1297,7249424,Nephrotic syndrome associated with lithium therapy.,"Two patients on long-term lithium therapy developed the nephrotic syndrome. Ultrastructural study of a renal biopsy in each case showed extensive glomerular epithelial cell foot process fusion. Lithium was withdrawn in each case. The nephrotic syndrome cleared without steroid therapy and has not recurred 18 months later in one patient. The other patient required a further course of treatment with lithium and the nephrotic syndrome returned. Further biopsy revealed a more severe glomerular lesion. The nephrotic syndrome responded again to withdrawal of lithium and institution of steroid therapy. Lithium is known to cause acute renal failure and tubulo-interstitial disease, but the recently described association with proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome is little recognized.",1981,5
1298,7258204,Treatment of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis with metronidazole.,"A case of successful treatment of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis with oral metronidazole is reported. A 67-year-old man developed diarrhea shortly after a 10-day course of oral ampicillin. His diarrhea, consisting of 10 to 12 loose stools a day, had continued for approximately two weeks and was accompanied with abdominal cramping, fever, anorexia, and weight loss. Stool specimen was streaked with blood. Proctoscopic examination revealed a spotty mucous exudate. Rectal biopsy analysis was consistent with pseudomembranous colitis. Metronidazole was initiated at a dose of 500 mg orally three times daily and continued for 10 days. By the third day, the patient was having one bowel movement daily. Proctoscopic examination after 10 days of therapy showed marked improvement with no evidence of pseudomembranous exudate. One month later the patient remained symptom-free.",1981,7
1299,7272895,Acute acoustic nerve palsy associated with vincristine therapy.,"A 73-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had two episodes of severe, bilateral, sensori-neural hearing loss after vincristine therapy. Her hearing gradually, then completely returned 2-3 months after the vincristine therapy was discontinued. Bilateral ear infections, central nervous system lymphoma and infection, or other drug-induced neuropathies were excluded as possible etiologies for the deafness. Bilateral acoustic (VIII) nerve palsy in this patient was most likely a manifestation of vincristine neurotoxicity.",1981,5
1300,7282702,Bradycardia and congestive heart failure associated with ocular timolol maleate.,"A case of timolol-associated heart failure in a 73-year old white man is reported. The patient, with a history of cardiovascular disease and glaucoma, was admitted to the hospital because of complaints of shortness of breath, orthopnea, and reduced exercise tolerance. Chest roentgenogram showed interstitial congestive failure, and an EKG demonstrated sinus bradycardia. The patient's medications before admission included quinidine, isosorbide dinitrate, dipyridamole, aspirin, pilocarpine eyedrops 4%, timolol eyedrops 0.5%, and nitroglycerin ointment and sublingual tablets. On the second day of hospitalization, it was noted that the patient's dyspnea and sinus bradycardia could be related to a recent increase in his timolol dosage. The timolol was discontinued, and the patient's heart rate increased. As the patient's pulse rate increased, the symptoms of congestive heart failure disappeared. This case demonstrated the importance of obtaining complete drug histories from patients. The potential for adverse system reactions resulting from topical medications should be considered.",1981,5
1301,7295427,Fatal ventricular fibrillation after treatment with digoxin in a 27-year-old man with mitral leaflet prolapse syndrome.,"A 27-year-old man with typical mitral leaflet prolapse syndrome was under medical care for eight years with ventricular arrhythmias resistant to various antiarrhythmic drugs. He was started on digoxin, 0.25 mg daily, because of echocardiographically demonstrated left ventricular dilatation and functional impairment; he died of ventricular fibrillation 15 days later.",1981,9
1302,7304798,Induction of rapid mood cycling during L-dopa treatment in a bipolar patient.,The authors report a longitudinal case study of a woman with a history of bipolar affective disorder in which L-dopa shortened the manic-depressive cycle length when administered in a double-blind trial. This finding suggests a dopaminergic mechanism specifically in changing the frequency of cycling between depression and mania.,1981,12
1303,7321956,Liver disease induced by perhexiline maleate.,This paper reports a case of fatal perhexiline maleate liver injury. A 62-year-old man had received perhexiline maleate for 18 months before death. Hepatic failure developed after a routine surgical procedure. The clinical course and histological findings are presented.,1981,11
1304,7351000,Acute non-lymphocytic leukemia in patients with ovarian carcinoma following long-term treatment with Treosulfan (= dihydroxybusulfan).,"Acute non-lymphocytic leukemia occurred in eight women following long-term treatment with Treosulfan (= dihydroxybusulfan) for ovarian carcinoma. The leukemia developed from 21 to 58 months (median 50 months) after the institution of chemotherapy. At the time when the leukemia appeared seven of the patients were in complete, and one in partial, remission as regards the ovarian carcinoma. Seven of the eight cases of acute leukemia occurred in a series of 553 patients treated with Treosulfan for ovarian cancer in the period from 1970 to 1977 and followed closely for a total of 1159 patient-years up to February 1978. As compared with an expected number of 0.04 cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia based on patient-years, the observed seven cases correspond to a 175-times increased risk. Although the cumulative probability of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia among surviving patients at five years using life-table statistics was 7.6%, the survival curve for the 553 patients with ovarian carcinoma was only slightly affected by death from leukemia. The probability of developing acute leukemia in this study was not significantly correlated to the total cumulative dosage of Treosulfan. Cytogenetic studies of the bone marrow performed after the development of acute leukemia showed chromosome abnormalities in all five patients examined, with hypodiploidy and loss of B and C group chromosomes.",1980,1
1305,7355327,Propranolol-related bronchospasm in patients without history of asthma.,"Three patients with no history of asthma or allergy developed bronchospasm while taking propranolol for hypertension. The bronchospasm was severe in all three and in one patient resulted in respiratory arrest. Since the bronchospasm was relieved with discontinuation of propranolol and supportive bronchodilator therapy, the bronchospasm was believed to be caused by propranolol. Furthermore, each patient was subsequently treated with other antihypertensive medications which, like propranolol, contain the stabilizer additive tartrazine. Bronchospasm did not recur, making it unlikely that tartrazine hypersensitivity caused this problem. Regardless of a negative history of asthma, therefore, life-threatening bronchospasm must be considered a possible complication of propranolol therapy.",1980,2
1306,7362333,Propranolol: an unrecognized cause of central nervous system dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.,"An organic mental syndrome developed in a patient soon after he underwent repair of a dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm. The operation was accomplished with cardiopulmonary bypass. Initially, the mental changes were thought to be related to the operation. However, they subsequently were shown to be associated with propranolol. The potential role of propranolol in inducing central nervous system disturbances is emphasized, and the literature on the subject is reviewed.",1980,4
1307,736591,Progressive interstitial lung disease from prolonged methotrexate therapy.,Progressive interstitial fibrosis with roentgenographic honeycombing developed in the case of a psoriatic patient who had been on a regimen of methotrexate for 18 years. Examination revealed a combined restrictive and obstructive defect in pulmonary mechanics and severe compromise of gas transfer across the pulmonary alveolar-capillary membrane. Improvement in the level of arterial blood gases and pulmonary diffusing capacity occurred after discontinuation of methotrexate therapy. Interstitial fibrosis of the lung is a potential complication of methotrexate therapy for psoriasis.,1978,12
1308,7369302,Abnormalities of the pupil and visual-evoked potential in quinine amblyopia.,"Total blindness with a transient tonic pupillary response, denervation supersensitivity, and abnormal visual-evoked potentials developed in a 54-year-old man after the use of quinine sulfate for leg cramps. He later recovered normal visual acuity. A transient tonic pupillary response, denervation supersensitivity, and abnormal visual-evoked potentials in quinine toxicity, to our knowledge, have not been previously reported.",1980,3
1309,7375145,Test and teach. Number twenty-one. Diagnosis: practolol induced sclerosing peritonitis.,"A relatively uncommon but unique and life threatening iatrogenic condition is described. There are few aids to diagnosis but once it is known that the patient has been on practolol the surgical and pathological findings are pathognomonic. Other practolol related side effects are usually present in the patient. The conditions may develop months or possibly years after cessation of intake of the drug and further cases may occur, although practolol has been withdrawn from use. Awareness of the condition is therefore of continuing importance.",1980,1
1310,7379406,Niflumic acid-induced skeletal fluorosis: iatrogenic disease or therapeutic perspective for osteoporosis?,"A case of skeletal fluorosis induced by prolonged treatment with niflumic acid, a fast-acting non-steroid antiinflammatory agent, is reported in a 35-year-old woman suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and treated, in addition, with corticosteroids. The case report discussed is, to our knowledge, the third of its kind regarding bone fluorosis resulting from use of this nicotinic derivative. This clinically asymptomatic case of skeletal fluorosis was discovered, as in the 2 previously reported cases, by the examination of bone X-ray (performed as part of the routine work-up for rheumatoid arthritis) which showed evident osteosclerosis. Quantitative histologic study of iliac crest biopsy revealed marked increase in trabecular bone volume and osteoid volume, suggestive of fluorosis. Abnormally high urine and bone fluoride confirmed the diagnosis. After ruling out a hydrotelluric source of fluorine, the patient's fluorosis was linked to chronic use of niflumic acid, following the publication in 1978 of the 2 previously reported cases affected by this drug. The fluorine contained in niflumic acid induced a marked densification of trabecular bone in all 3 cases. Long-term clinical and pharmacokinetic studies will be required to determine whether or not niflumic acid can be employed in the prevention or treatment of both of apparently idiopathic osteoporosis or corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.",1980,5
1311,7387219,Hepatotoxicity associated with use of D-penicillamine in rheumatoid arthritis.,"Two patients with rheumatoid arthritis developed evidence of hepatotoxicity while receiving D-penicillamine. Both recovered after withdrawal of the drug. These cases and a review of the literature suggested that hepatotoxicity, though rare, should be added to the list of adverse reactions to D-penicillamine.",1980,4
1312,7393795,Para-aminosalicylic acid-induced hypoglycaemia in a patient with diabetic nephropathy.,"A 62-year-old Indian with diabetic nephropathy controlled with metformin, developed miliary tuberculosis for which he was treated with rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol. Soon afterwards he developed cholestatic hepatitis and visual disturbance. Rifampicin and ethambutol were stopped. Streptomycin caused vertigo and had to be stopped. The introduction of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) led to hypoglycaemic coma. Metformin was stopped. Hypoglycaemic coma recurred. PAS was stopped and the patient's blood glucose concentrations became normal. Treatment with isoniazid and ethambutol led to total recovery from pulmonary tuberculosis. The induction of hypoglycaemia with PAS in this patient suggests a potential role for PAS in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.",1980,2
1313,7397053,Papilloedema and hepatic dysfunction apparently induced by perhexiline maleate (Pexid).,A patient developed papilloedema and hepatic dysfunction while being treated with perhexiline maleate. These later regressed when the drug was withdrawn. Patients should be monitored for these potentially serious side-effects while on this drug.,1980,4
1314,7408538,Unusual pigmentary changes associated with 5-fluorouracil therapy.,"A fifty-six year old black man with stage D carcinoma of the prostate was treated weekly with 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 for twenty-four consecutive doses. The total amount received was 27 gm. A good partial remission was attained. Little hematologic and no gastrointestinal or central nervous system toxicity was experienced. The patient did experience nasal mucosal friability and diffuse hyperpigmentation of the face and hands. Markedly increased pigmementation of skin immediately overlying veins used for multiple 5-fluorouracil infusions was noted. Because of its unusual appearance, the name serpentine supravenous fluorouracil hyperpigmentation is suggested for this entity.",1980,8
1315,7416268,Disulfiram encephalopathy as a cause of the catatonia syndrome.,"The authors describe a case of the catatonia syndrome associated with disulfiram therapy. Although useful in the management of chronic alcoholism, disulfiram is being increasingly associated with a wide spectrum of side effects and untoward medical sequelae, which now include catatonia. The authors note that catatonia is a clinical syndrome associated with multiple medical conditions as well as psychiatric disorders.",1980,10
1316,7420580,Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion after high dose vinblastine.,We report on a patient with an embryonal teratocarcinoma of the testicle who had the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone after receiving a high dose of vinblastine. His clinical course and laboratory studies are discussed. We suggest that patients receiving a high dose of vinblastine are at risk for the development of this syndrome.,1980,5
1317,7428724,Oesophageal ulceration due to emepronium bromide.,"Four cases of oesophageal damage associated with ingestion of the urinary anti-spasmodic agent emepronium bromide are described. All the patients presented with severe retrosternal pain worsened by swallowing food and drink, and in every case fibre-optic endoscopy revealed ulceration of the midoesophagus. Symptoms disappeared rapidly following cessation of emepromium bromide therapy. The means whereby this agent might injure oseophageal mucosa are discussed.",1980,9
1318,7436161,Cardiorespiratory toxicity due to miconazole.,"Seven patients with hematologic malignancies who were treated with miconazole for either suspected or proven fungal infections developed eight episodes of major adverse cardiorespiratory and anaphylactic reactions. All the episodes occurred after the first dose was administered, and the seven patients recovered without sequelae after the drug was withdrawn. None of them had a history of cardiac disease, and with the possible exception of one case of cardiac arrest, where the patient received doxorubicin, no predisposing factors could be found. The rate and length of administration, as well as the dose, should be carefully monitored to avoid these complications.",1980,9
1319,7439122,Clofibrate-induced myopathy in patients with diabetes insipidus.,"Clofibrate has been considered to be a relatively safe antidiuretic in the treatment of diabetes insipidus. However, we have recently had four cases of clofibrate-induced myopathy in patients with diabetes insipidus due to hypothalamic lesions. Physicians should therefore be aware of its occurrence and carefully monitor serum levels of CPK, GOT and GPT during the treatment of diabetes insipidus with clofibrate, especially in patients with associated hypothyroidism, latent or overt, which possibly favors the development of myopathy.",1980,6
1320,7448830,Hepatotoxicity of hycanthone in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"Hycanthone is an antischistosomal drug with promising antitumor activity against experimental animal tumors. In phase I clinical trials, hepatitis weas the dose-limiting toxic effect and a dose of 60-70 mg/m2/day for 5 days was reported as the maximum-tolerated dose. In a phase II study of hycanthone in patients with breast cancer we have recently observed severe hepatotoxicity, even at lower doses, which resulted in two drug-related deaths. From this study and the previously available data, we conclude that this drug is too toxic for human trials at the currently recommended doses. Its radiosensitizing effect may be worth exploring at a lower dose level.",0,0
1321,7459812,Fatal interstitial pneumonitis following high-dose intermittent chlorambucil therapy for chronic lymphocyte leukemia.,"Interstitial lung disease has been reported in association with numerous alkylating agents and other chemotherapeutic drugs. Chlorambucil has only rarely been implicated in this complication. We report a case of a 74-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who received high-dose intermittent chlorambucil and prednisone every two weeks. Following several of these courses of therapy, respiratory distress occurred 9 to 12 days after the chlorambucil was given. During the final episode, open lung biopsy was performed and demonstrated typical changes of drug-induced pneumonitis, with interstitial infiltrates and fibrosis and proliferation of type II alveolar lining cells.",1981,1
1322,7468565,Barbiturate-induced submassive hepatic necrosis. Report of a case and review of the literature.,"A case of barbiturate-induced submassive hepatic necrosis is presented and the literature is reviewed. The patient's clinical presentation, histologic features on liver biopsy and favorable course after stopping the drug suggest that barbiturates can be added to the list of agents which can cause submassive hepatic necrosis.",1980,9
1323,7474364,Sustained-release procainamide-induced reversible granulocytopenia after myocardial infarction.,"A 71-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who had a previous anterior myocardial infarction exhibited granulocytopenia 8 days following the administration of oral sustained-release procainamide (750 mg/day). The plasma concentrations of procainamide and N-acetyl procainamide were at subtherapeutic levels. Discontinuation of procainamide led to complete recovery. A bone marrow aspiration showed slight hypoplasia with normocellular marrow. Lupus erythematosus (LE) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests were negative. The frequency and relationship of granulocytopenia caused by sustained-release procainamide in patients with tachyarrhythmias are briefly discussed, and prior reported cases are reviewed. Precautionary measures for the early recognition of this grave hazard in exposed patients are advocated. The physician should be aware of this complication before in initiating treatment with this drug.",1995,7
1324,748238,Monoclonal gammopathy and subsequent multiple myeloma in a patient on chronic diphenylhydantoin therapy.,The development of an IgG lambda-type monoclonal gammopathy and subsequent multiple myeloma in an epilepsy patient on diphenylhydantoin (DILANTIN) therapy for 20 years is reported. We regard the association recorded in this case to be a coincidence despite the known association between the drug and the development of immunosuppression and lymphoma. We recommended periodic examination of the serum proteins in patients receiving diphenylhydantoin in order to detect development of monoclonal gammopathy.,1978,12
1325,7485371,Vortex keratopathy associated with atovaquone.,"We studied a case of vortex keratopathy that was associated with the use of atovaquone.
A patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with pulmonary Pneumocystis carinii was treated with 750 mg of atovaquone three times a day.
Similar to previous findings of drug-induced vortex keratopathy, atovaquone vortex keratopathy is presumably caused by its lipophilic properties. This property is similar to that of other lipophilic agents such as amiodarone, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, quinacrine, and suramin.
Atovaquone should be added to the list of agents causing vortex keratopathy involving the corneal epithelium.",1995,11
1326,7495990,Opioid use in HIV patients with neurological changes.,"The neurological changes that are common in the HIV population may complicate the use of analgesics, particularly opioids. These changes, in combination with care providers' fear of opioids, often lead to the inappropriate use of antagonists, such as naloxone. Used injudiciously, naloxone can lead to withdrawal syndrome, return of severe pain, and other adverse effects. The authors describe the many disease and treatment-related causes for pain in patients with HIV disease, as well as common neurologic conditions that alter cognition and complicate the use of opioids. A case study is included to illustrate the dangers of inappropriate naloxone use.",0,0
1327,7519913,Review of antithyroid drug use during pregnancy and report of a case of aplasia cutis.,"Thioamide therapy has improved the outcome of pregnancies complicated by maternal hyperthyroidism, without long-term effects on cognitive and somatic development. However, there remain questions concerning whether these drugs, especially methimazole (MMI), may be associated with aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) and how best to avoid impairment of fetal thyroid function during their use. We report an example of ACC and review the relevant literature. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence either to establish or eliminate a direct causal relationship between ACC and MMI use. Since propylthiouracil is an equally effective antithyroid agent and has not been associated with ACC, it is the preferred thioamide for hyperthyroidism during pregnancy. Our review also indicates that impairment of neonatal thyroid function may be minimized by using a thioamide dose that is just sufficient to maintain the maternal serum free thyroxine concentration in the high normal or slightly thyrotoxic range.",1994,0
1328,7526455,Acute reversible ataxo-myoclonic encephalopathy with flecainide therapy.,"A 73 year-old patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and paroxysmic supraventricular tachycardia developed an acute reversible encephalopathy within 15 days of initiation of flecainide. The clinical picture was characterized by visual hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, but no disorientation, and a severe cerebello-myoclonic syndrome with total inability to stand up and walk, which was fully reversible on discontinuing the medication.",1994,0
1329,7538828,Bone marrow aplasia and severe skin rash after a single low dose of methotrexate.,"A 64 year old man with recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck developed severe skin rash and bone marrow aplasia 4 and 7 days, respectively, following a single dose of 40 mg/m2 methotrexate (MTX). Skin rash involved regions of the face, lower abdomen, back, buttocks and both upper thighs. Biopsy of the skin rash demonstrated superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and was consistent with a drug reaction. Peripheral blood count revealed pancytopenia and a bone marrow biopsy was consistent with aplasia. Blood counts returned to normal 6 days after institution of granulocyte colony stimulating factor therapy. In the absence of mucositis or diarrhea, severe dermatologic toxicity following a single low dose of the drug suggests an 'allergic' or acute hypersensitivity reaction to MTX in this patient. Development of an extensive skin rash following a single dose of MTX may be an early warning sign for life-threatening bone marrow aplasia.",1995,2
1330,7545251,Chlormadinone acetate withdrawal syndrome under combined androgen blockade for advanced prostate cancer.,"Between July 1991 and December 1994 at Tsukuba Gakuen Hospital, we treated 19 consecutive men with advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate (five at stage C, four at stage D1 and 10 at stage D2). Of these, 14 patients underwent castration (two patients) or received LH-RH analogue (12 patients) plus chlormadinone acetate for combined androgen blockade. We report three representative cases of sequential prostate specific antigen (PSA) elevation following initial response to this combined androgen blockade. Discontinuation of chlormadinone acetate resulted in decline of the serum PSA level. This suggests that trial chlormadinone acetate withdrawal in patients showing increasing levels of PSA during combined androgen blockade should be considered before initiation of alternative treatment.",1995,8
1331,7549443,Drug induced myopia associated with treatment for gynecological problems.,"We present three cases of women who developed acute transient myopia caused by drugs for gynecological problems. One patient was treated with disothiazide for premenstrual edema. The second had acute cystitis and was treated by sulphonamide and the third developed myopia coincident with metronidazole treatment for trichomonas vaginalis. We followed these patients by A scan ultrasonographic ocular measurements, documenting reduction of the anterior chamber depth combined with lens thickening. The ocular and myopic changes cleared up completely on discontinuation of the causative agent. The possible mechanism is thought to be an allergic reaction to the drug.",0,0
1332,7577414,Nephrotic syndrome related to systemic lupus erythematosus after griseofulvin therapy.,"We report a 16-year-old male who developed nephrotic syndrome related to membranous glomerulopathy with clinical and serological evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus after treatment with griseofulvin. To our knowledge, this is the first case of griseofulvin-exacerbated lupus in which nephrotic syndrome has been observed.",1995,8
1333,7582710,Neurological side effects in two patients receiving gold injections for rheumatoid arthritis.,"We describe two patients who developed neurological side effects as part of the spectrum of nitritoid reactions. Both reactions occurred late in the course of treatment. The first patient developed mild nitritoid symptoms and pain in a band-like distribution, corresponding to T10-T12 dermatomes, shortly after gold sodium thiomalate (GSTM) injection. Further injections were followed by similar symptoms in addition to paraesthesiae and altered pin-prick sensation of anterior thigh and legs with no residual deficit. She has had no further episodes since substitution of aurothioglucose. The second patient experienced mild nitritoid symptoms following several GSTM injections prior experiencing a cerebrovascular accident within several hours of her next injection. She subsequently haemorrhaged into the infarcted area with residual neurological deficits. These cases highlight that nitritoid reactions can be severe and may be heralded by milder symptoms. Patients who develop these reactions whilst receiving GSTM can be successfully changed to aurothioglucose.",1995,10
1334,7594371,Acute sensorineural hearing loss following intravenous ketoralac administration.,"Ketoralac is an injectable nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) widely used in both out-patient and in-patient settings. Side effects such as acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, gastritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and asthmatic exacerbation, although rare, have been previously reported. We report the case of a 20-year-old female with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) who developed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss 25 minutes after receiving 30 mg of intravenous ketoralac. The patient denied any previous medication sensitivities, and was taking oral methotrexate and prednisone at the time of emergency department admission. Both PAN and methotrexate have been independently demonstrated to cause sensorineural hearing loss. We postulate that the patient's hearing loss was the result of ketoralac's direct and indirect ototoxic effects that were potentiated as a result of her underlying illness and medications. We recommend the cautious use of ketorolac in patients with underlying illnesses where NSAID-induced ototoxicity could result in adverse otologic consequences.",0,0
1335,7606071,Anaphylactoid reactions with intraperitoneal cisplatin.,"To report the occurrence of anaphylactoid reactions to intraperitoneal cisplatin in 3 patients.
While conducting a protocol evaluating the efficacy of intraperitoneal cisplatin and hyperthermia in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer, 3 patients were noted to exhibit anaphylactoid reactions. A 43-year-old woman received cisplatin 60 mg/m2 in 15 minutes during her sixth cycle of therapy. She developed pruritus, edema, and urticaria over both hands. The reaction subsided after treatment with diphenhydramine and dexamethasone. A 57-year-old woman received 400 mL (62.4 mg) of a cisplatin solution concentrated to deliver cisplatin 100 mg/m2 during her first attempted therapy. At this point, she developed whole body urticaria and pruritus with edema of the extremities. The reaction was aborted with diphenhydramine and dexamethasone. Despite premedication with dexamethasone prior to a second attempt at therapy, she again experienced similar symptoms after receiving 500 mL (78 mg) of cisplatin solution. A 55-year-old woman received 2 cycles of therapy with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 without difficulty. During her third cycle, she again received cisplatin 100 mg/m2 over 30 minutes and developed palmar pruritus, urticaria, and edema. Symptomatology resolved with diphenhydramine. Despite premedication with diphenhydramine and dexamethasone, she experienced generalized pruritus and urticaria, as well as headache and chest pain/tightness, after her next infusion. For both the second and third patients, symptomatology failed to resolve until the intraperitoneal cisplatin solution was withdrawn.
Anaphylactoid reactions have been described previously with cisplatin administration. No dose-rate effect has been reported, however. We observed 5 reactions in 3 patients that appear to be related to a high dose-infusion time ratio, indicating that dose and rate of infusion may be important factors in precipitating anaphylactoid reactions with cisplatin.
We conclude that a high dose combined with a short infusion time increases the risk of anaphylactoid reactions with the administration of intraperitoneal cisplatin. There was no indication that the increase in anaphylactoid reactions was associated with the use of hyperthermia.",1995,3
1336,7619765,Etoposide-related myocardial infarction.,"The occurrence of a myocardial infarction is reported after chemotherapy containing etoposide, in a man with no risk factors for coronary heart disease. Possible causal mechanisms are discussed.",1995,0
1337,7632529,Acute renal failure in a child associated with acyclovir.,"A 9-year-old boy developed acute renal failure following intravenous acyclovir (30 mg/kg per day) administered for 6 days to treat herpetic encephalitis. Physical findings and urine output were normal, except for increasing blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine and mild proteinuria. Acyclovir was discontinued. However BUN and serum creatinine continued to increase and peaked on the following day at 8.6 mmol/l of urea (24 mg/dl) and 194 mumol/l (2.2 mg/ml), respectively. Conservative treatment and hydration were carried out. The kidney function returned to normal within 1 week. The use of acyclovir when necessary in renal failure patients is discussed.",1995,6
1338,7639655,Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy secondary to interferon alfa.,"To report the occurrence of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy as a complication of treatment with interferon alfa and to consider the possible underlying mechanisms for this association.
Description of the clinical findings in two patients with this condition.
A neuro-ophthalmology referral center.
Two patients, ages 40 and 51 years, undergoing treatment with interferon alfa for malignant neoplasms experienced sudden bilateral, sequential visual loss with disc-related field defects and segmental optic disc edema.
Treatment with aspirin and prednisone in one patient.
Visual acuity, color vision, Goldmann perimetry testing, and fundus photography.
Visual loss was mild and generally nonprogressive. The interval between initiating treatment with interferon alfa and onset of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was similar to that of interferon-associated vascular retinopathy.
Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy may complicate treatment with interferon alfa. The underlying pathogenesis is probably multifactorial.",1995,8
1339,7647084,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and lithium carbonate.,The authors describe a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome that occurred in a patient on amitriptyline and lithium carbonate. They suggest that lithium-antidepressant combination can precipitate this syndrome. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction was a prominent feature in the patient in this study.,1995,7
1340,7655130,Two cases of therapeutic failure associated with levothyroxine brand interchange.,"To report the loss of therapeutic control in 2 hypothyroid patients and remind clinical pharmacists and other healthcare professionals to remain cognizant of possible product quality differences within or bioequivalency differences between levothyroxine products.
Two patients with stable hypothyroidism experienced symptoms of hypothyroidism with increased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations after switching from 1 levothyroxine product to another. One tablet from 1 of the patient's levothyroxine prescriptions was assayed, and its levothyroxine content was 74.5% of the label claim, a value outside of the United States Pharmacopeia requirements of 90-110%.
Two patients with hypothyroidism had remained euthyroid and stable while receiving 1 levothyroxine product, but became symptomatic with dramatically increased serum TSH concentrations while receiving what were thought to be comparable dosages of another levothyroxine product. Therapeutic control was reestablished in both patients after therapy with the original levothyroxine product was reinstated.
Clinical pharmacists and other healthcare professionals should remain cognizant of possible product quality differences within or bioequivalency differences between levothyroxine products. These differences necessitate close monitoring of hypothyroid patients, counseling these patients about the clinical signs of sub- and supratherapeutic levothyroxine dosages, and prudence when switching patients with stable hypothyroidism to alternative levothyroxine products. If there are inconsistencies between levothyroxine products, resultant deleterious effects on the therapeutic stability of patients with hypothyroidism may undermine cost savings that might be incurred by such a change. If these patients are switched to alternative levothyroxine products, it is recommended that thyroid function tests be repeated after equilibration to the new product.",1995,5
1341,7661076,Life-threatening alterations in heart rate after the use of adenosine in atrial flutter.,"Adenosine has become the preferred treatment for common types of supraventricular tachycardia because it is extremely effective and rarely associated with with serious side effects. It has also been advocated as an intervention for diagnostic use to assess uncommon types of tachycardia. Evidence is shown in this report that adenosine was associated with dangerous worsening of arrhythmia in patients with atrial flutter. In two patients, adenosine precipitated acceleration of ventricular response, in one case necessitating emergent cardioversion. Both patients had atrial flutter with 2 to 1 atrioventricular block that evolved into 1 to 1 atrioventricular conduction. In three other patients, adenosine was associated with prolonged bradyasystole and hypotension. In each of the five patients, adenosine was given in a standard fashion (6 or 12 mg). In summary, adenosine should be recognized as a potentially dangerous intervention in patients with atrial flutter. If it is used for diagnostic purposes, resuscitative equipment should be readily available.",1995,9
1342,7663030,Probable propafenone-induced transient global amnesia.,"To describe a probable case of transient global amnesia caused by propafenone. This adverse effect has not been previously described for this agent.
A 61-year old man with a history of sick sinus syndrome with persistent atrial fibrillation and infrequent premature ventricular contractions was admitted to the hospital for symptoms of amnesia and disorientation to time, place, and date. He began taking propafenone only 6 days prior to admission because of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation and symptoms of fatigue. His atrial fibrillation subsequently had converted to normal sinus rhythm while he received propafenone without adverse effects prior to this episode. His symptoms of amnesia resolved approximately 6-7 hours after discontinuing the propafenone therapy.
Propafenone is a class 1C antiarrhythmic agent that blocks fast sodium channels in heart muscle and Purkinje fibers similar to the action of encainide and flecainide. It also produces weak beta- and calcium-channel blockade. It has a significant adverse effect profile, with 30-45% of patients reporting cardiac adverse effects and 15-20% experiencing noncardiac events. Central nervous system effects that parallel amnesia have been reported in 10-15% of the patients, including dizziness, ataxia, drowsiness, fatigue, confusion, and paranoia. Propafenone's distribution, clearance, and structural similarity to propranolol contribute to its central nervous system effects.
The rapid resolution of this patient's symptoms after discontinuing propafenone therapy and the absence of recurrence lend credence to the probability of this effect. Comparable adverse effects, such as disorientation and temporary amnesia, have been reported in patients in the analogous agent, propranolol. Consequently, this is a likely, although rare, possible adverse effect with propafenone for which patients should be monitored.",1995,6
1343,7668127,Intracranial haemorrhage from a meningioma in a patient receiving aspirin prophylaxis: a case report.,A case of acute subdural haematoma originating spontaneously from an angiomatous meningioma in a patient receiving prophylactic aspirin therapy is presented. To the best of our knowledge no comparable case and no discussion of possible complications of aspirin prophylaxis in patients with brain tumours have been published. Possible reasons and clinical significance of this complication are discussed. This observation questions the suitability of aspirin as prophylaxis for vascular disease in patients with meningiomas.,1995,0
1344,7673653,Beneficial effect of low-dose mianserin on fluvoxamine-induced akathisia in an obsessive-compulsive patient.,"Extrapyramidal side effects induced by some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), i.e. fluoxetine and sertraline, have been previously reported in patients with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the occurrence and management of akathisia induced by fluvoxamine have not been described. In the presented case fluvoxamine-induced akathisia in an OCD patient was partially resistant to the anticholinergic agent biperiden, and was successfully treated with the 5-HT2A/5-HT2C antagonist mianserin. Mianserin (15 mg/day at 21.00 h) was discontinued and then reinstituted (off-on-off-on design). Biperiden was transiently effective in the acute akathisia, while the more persistent akathisia was alleviated by mianserin. Discontinuation of mianserin resulted in recurrence of akathisia, while full amelioration of the symptoms of akathisia was noted when mianserin was reinstituted. No aggravation of OCD symptoms was noted during mianserin administration.",1995,6
1345,7679525,Severe bleomycin lung toxicity: reversal with high dose corticosteroids.,"A 42 year old man, treated for testicular carcinoma with combination chemotherapy that included bleomycin, developed life threatening interstitial pneumonitis. He recovered successfully after treatment with very high doses of corticosteroids and azathioprine. This report suggests that bleomycin lung toxicity may be reversible if treated aggressively.",1993,1
1346,7685228,Reversal of gold-induced neutropenia with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).,"We have successfully overcome severe neutropenia in an RA patient treated with gold salts, using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), reducing the duration of neutropenia and risk of infection. The patient suffered no side effects, and use of G-CSF represents an important addition to the management of a life-threatening drug reaction.",1993,6
1347,7696938,Correction of serum electrolyte imbalance prevents cardiac arrhythmia during amphotericin B administration.,"Arrhythmias and cardiac arrest have been reported during amphotericin B administration but no effective technique has been described to prevent them. I saw two patients with kala-azar resistant to sodium stibogluconate who developed cardiac arrest after amphotericin infusion (in spite of tolerating a test dose). Both had low levels of serum sodium, potassium and calcium. After these were corrected the amphotericin B was restarted and the course of treatment completed successfully. I suggest that prior to giving amphotericin B to patients with resistant kala-azar their electrolyte imbalance should be corrected.",0,0
1348,7712052,Lithium for irritability in post-traumatic stress disorder.,"Irritability is often a problem for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). We describe two cases that illustrate the use of lithium in the treatment of veterans with PTSD who complained of serious problems with irritability or angry outbursts. These cases are discussed in the context of evidence that lithium may be useful in other patients with disorders of impulse control. The evidence linking disorders of anger and impulse control to a dysregulation in neurotransmitter regulation, particularly in serotonergic pathways, supports a psychopharmacologic approach to treatment. These findings should lead to further study of the role of lithium in the treatment of this symptom complex in patients with PTSD.",1995,1
1349,7718983,Graves' hyperthyroidism following transient thyrotoxicosis during interferon therapy for chronic hepatitis type C.,"We report a case of Graves' hyperthyroidism induced by long-term interferon (IFN) therapy. A 52-year-old woman suffered from chronic active hepatitis type C and was treated with a total of 456 x 10(6) units of IFN-alpha for 23 weeks. During the 12th week of treatment she showed transient thyrotoxicosis. One week after the termination of IFN therapy, TSH-receptor antibodies became positive and subsequently she showed Graves' hyperthyroidism. This case showed sequential manifestation from transient thyrotoxicosis to the appearance of TSH-receptor autoantibodies, and then the occurrence of Graves' hyperthyroidism during IFN therapy. The course of this case may be useful in the understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune hyperthyroidism.",1995,1
1350,7724306,Acute isoniazid neurotoxicity in an urban hospital.,"To describe the presentation and treatment of acute isoniazid (INH) neurotoxicity appearing at an inner-city municipal hospital.
Case series.
Seven patients (eight patient visits) with an age range of 5 days to 14.9 years.
At our institution, no children appeared with acute INH neurotoxicity in the period 1985 through 1990, whereas seven patients were treated from 1991 through 1993. This paralleled the rise in the number of children with tuberculous infection and disease seen at our institution, from an average 96 per year to 213 per year during these two time periods. All seven patients were receiving INH daily for tuberculosis (TB) prophylaxis. Accidental ingestion (five episodes) and suicidal attempts (three episodes) accounted for these visits. The total amount ingested range from 14.3 to 99.3 mg/kg (mean, 54 mg/kg). All but one patient presented with afebrile seizures. One patient presented twice with seizures. Acute INH neurotoxicity was not suspected on the first admission; however, when readmitted 4 weeks later with another seizure, the diagnosis of acute INH neurotoxicity was made.
Intravenous pyridoxine was used in five episodes. Because it was not a stocked item in our pediatric emergency cart (as well as at another hospital, necessitating a transfer of a patient with refractory seizures to our hospital), the average delay was 5.8 hours (range, 1.3 to 13 hours) before it was given. Two patients with refractory seizures failed to respond to anticonvulsants, and their seizures were controlled only after parenteral pyridoxine.
We have seen an increased incidence of acute INH neurotoxicity because of the resurgence of TB in New York City. Others as well may see a similar rise based on local trends in TB infection and disease. Acute INH toxicity should be suspected in children presenting with seizures with or without fever. In patients with a known access to INH, seizures should be considered to be caused by INH toxicity unless proved otherwise. Parenteral pyridoxine, the specific antidote for INH-induced refractory seizures, should be readily available in every emergency department in the areas similarly experiencing increasing trends of TB.",1995,5
1351,7730124,Arterial hypertension associated with topical ocular use of phenylephrine in dogs.,"In 3 dogs scheduled for surgical removal of cataracts, systemic and topical treatment with antibiotics and topical ocular treatment with prednisolone, atropine, flurbiprofen, and phenylephrine were used to achieve maximal mydriasis, with minimal risk of pupillary constriction in response to surgery. Each dog developed arterial hypertension, with systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures ranging from 170 to 205, 90 to 112, and 123 to 148 mm of Hg, respectively. Hypertension was treated with acepromazine maleate (0.001 to 0.005 mg/kg of body weight) i.v., decreasing arterial pressures to reference values. Phenylephrine dosages for topical use ranged from 50 to 367 times greater than the i.v. dose required to increase arterial pressure by 50% in anesthetized dogs. Although adverse sequelae to these episodes of hypertension were not noticed, this report documents the uptake of phenylephrine from topical ocular application and suggests the need for dose-response measurements for this adjunct to mydriatic treatment in dogs.",1994,12
1352,7748076,Endometrial squamous metaplasia. An unusual response to progestin therapy of hyperplasia.,"To report the finding of squamous metaplasia within endometrial glands occurring as a result of progestin therapy of hyperplasia.
Case series. Retrospective analysis of two cases from 9235 accessioned endometrial biopsies.
Hospital-based pathology laboratory processing inpatient and outpatient specimens.
Two women, ages 49 and 34 years, with endometrial hyperplasia without squamous metaplasia who were treated with progestin.
Extensive squamous metaplasia was found in endometrial glands following progestin therapy. The post-therapy biopsies also showed progestin-related alterations but no evidence of active hyperplasia.
Squamous metaplasia in these cases appears to be a consequence of progestin therapy. The absence of hyperplasia in the progestin-treated endometrium suggests that the squamous metaplasia does not represent persistence or progression of the original hyperplastic lesion.",1995,5
1353,7752014,Furosemide-associated fever.,We describe a 5-month-old infant who had fever of unknown origin leading to an exhaustive evaluation during a 7-week period. Fever caused by the use of furosemide was proved; the fever resolved after discontinuation of this medication and recurred after its reintroduction.,1995,5
1354,7756684,Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of a novel mitomycin C analog KW-2149.,"KW-2149 is a new, semisynthetic, C-7-N-substituted, mitomycin C (MMC) analog showing equal or superior antitumor activity in both in vitro and in vivo assays. The preclinical activity profile combined with the hematological toxicity data in rodents and the water solubility of the compound compare favorably with MMC. The aim of this phase I study was to determine the toxicity profile and the optimal dosage of KW-2149. In this phase I study 37 patients received 97 courses of KW-2149 administered as an i.v. bolus injection every 21 days at sequential dose levels: 5, 10, 17, 25, 35, 47, 60, 75, 90 and 100 mg/m2. Hematological toxicity was moderate even at the 100 mg/m2 dose level. Grade IV leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in one of three patients at the 100 mg/m2 dose level. There was some evidence of a delayed-type bone marrow toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity was dose limiting, with grade III toxicity occurring in all three patients treated at a dose of 100 mg/m2. The type of lung toxicity was similar to the one observed with other antitumor antibiotics. No renal or cardiac toxicity was observed. Other toxicities were generally mild. Antitumor activity was observed in four patients. Data of drug monitoring demonstrated rapid metabolism and/or distribution of KW-2149 with a short half-life and the emergence of the cytotoxic metabolites M-16 and M-18. The dose-limiting toxicity of KW-2149 is pulmonary toxicity.",1995,2
1355,7761316,The development of rickets as a complication of chemotherapy for the treatment of Wilms' tumor.,"Musculoskeletal complaints were the presenting symptoms in four of 44 children (9%) treated for relapsed Wilms' tumors with ifosfamide, a derivative of cyclophosphamide. Subsequent radiologic examination revealed rachitic bone and joint changes. A fifth child manifested clinical and radiographic signs of rickets after presenting with hypophosphatemia, hypouricemia, and glycosuria. Recognition of a potential drug-induced Fanconi syndrome is important when managing pediatric oncology patients previously treated with ifosfamide. Early replacement therapy is recommended when proximal renal tubular abnormalities are detected to help prevent and control the severe metabolic bone disease associated with the Fanconi syndrome.",1995,3
1356,7776854,Severe hepatotoxicity related to benzarone: a report of three cases with two fatalities.,"We report three cases of severe hepatotoxicity related to benzarone, a benzofuran derivative. Our cases include a 35-year-old woman with (sub)fulminant hepatitis, a 67-year-old woman with macronodular cirrhosis, and a 68-year-old man with severe chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis, with positivity of anti-smooth muscle antibodies. Two patients died. We stress the potential of benzarone to cause hepatotoxicity, which usually resembles severe chronic active hepatitis. Our cases constitute the most severe cases of benzarone hepatotoxicity reported so far, and comprise the first cases of (sub)fulminant hepatitis and cirrhosis related to benzarone.",1995,2
1357,7779233,Case study: a modified topical treatment regimen for sodium warfarin-induced necrotizing fasciitis.,"This case study describes an atypical case of refractory, sodium warfarin-induced necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis. This patient did not initially receive surgical debridement and systemic antibiotics, the standard treatment for necrotizing fasciitis of bacterial origin. This patient's wound care regimen began with silver sulfadiazine and wet-to-dry dressings, modified to initial cleansing with a zinc-saline solution, followed with application of a zinc-saline wet dressing, impregnated with an aluminum hydroxide ointment. The patient experienced pain relief after the first application. After 4 weeks, the necrotic tissue sloughed off, the early signs of healing appeared making surgical debridement possible. Therapy with the zinc-saline dressings was continued and restoration of all tissues was documented within 225 days. If aggressive surgical therapy is not an option, the prevention of secondary complications such as infection becomes the goal of treatment until the necrotic process stops and healing begins. For this goal, a moist environment may be the optimal choice for topical therapy.",0,0
1358,7781845,Mefloquine-associated hypoglycaemia in a cachectic AIDS patient.,"Quinine and its isomer quinidine are well-known causes of iatrogenic hypoglycaemia, due to excessive insulin secretion. The situation is less clear regarding other anti-malarial quinine analogues. In particular, this adverse effect has never been described with mefloquine (Lariam). We report a case of hypoglycaemia after mefloquine therapy (1,500 mg over two days) for severe gastrointestinal cryptosporidiasis in a cachectic AIDS patient with protracted diarrhoea. Blood glucose levels, which were normal before treatment, dropped to 2.3 mmol/l within a few hours and were corrected by i.v. glucose infusion. Hypoglycaemia did not recur despite continued treatment. Rat islets of Langerhans exposed to mefloquine in vitro (10(-8) mol/l to 10(-3) mol/l) secreted significantly more insulin than control islets (up to 980 +/- 180 microU/ml/5 islets incubated with mefloquine 10(-3) mol/l, vs 20 +/- 4 microU/ml/5 untreated islets). Mechanisms and triggering factors of hypoglycaemia induced by mefloquine and some other anti-malarial quinine analogues are discussed. Clinicians who manage cachectic patients, particularly those with protracted diarrhoea and/or receiving anti-malarial drugs including mefloquine, should be aware of the risk of severe hypoglycaemia.",1995,2
1359,7783891,Cardiac arrest following use of sumatriptan.,"I report a 35-year-old woman with occult coronary artery disease who experienced cardiac arrest within minutes after receiving a first-time dose of subcutaneous sumatriptan for migraine. The patient was resuscitated, and subsequent serial cardiac enzymes indicated myocardial infarction. Because sumatriptan can cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients with significant risk factors for coronary artery disease should be carefully evaluated for cardiovascular disease prior to the use of sumatriptan.",1995,6
1360,7787496,Sotalol-induced bradycardia reversed by glucagon.,Glucagon is considered the drug of choice for treating bradycardia and hypotension encountered during beta-blocker poisoning. Its potential usefulness in reversing adverse effects encountered during therapeutic dosing with beta-blockers has not been well characterized. We present a case of sotalol-induced bradycardia reversed by glucagon.,1995,4
1361,7789881,Secretory endometrial adenocarcinoma in a patient on tamoxifen for breast cancer: a report of a case.,Well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma of the secretory type (FIGO Grade 1) with minimal myometrial invasion occurred in a postmenopausal patient on tamoxifen therapy 5 years after mastectomy for breast carcinoma. We believe that this is the first report of secretory carcinoma of the endometrium associated with tamoxifen use. This unusual pattern of low-grade endometrial carcinoma adds to the spectrum of uterine neoplasia associated with tamoxifen therapy.,1995,7
1362,7797283,Esophageal candidiasis following omeprazole therapy: a report of two cases.,Esophageal candidiasis was diagnosed at endoscopy in two patients receiving omeprazole therapy. There was no clinical evidence of immunosuppression or any obstructive lesion in the esophagus. There was prompt response of oral ketoconazole. These cases suggest that marked acid reduction may predispose to esophageal candidial infection.,1995,4
1363,7814182,High-grade atrioventricular block during dipyridamole stress testing.,"Dipyridamole stress testing may be used in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and risk assessment of patients who are unable to exercise. Although dipyridamole perfusion imaging has a good safety record, serious side-effects may rarely occur. We present a case in which dipyridamole induced high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block that responded promptly to intravenous aminophylline but not to atropine.",1994,10
1364,7831179,Aggressive management of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy associated with 'low' doses of doxorubicin.,"There is a dose-effect relationship between doxorubicin and the incidence of symptomatic cardiac failure. It is generally thought that doses below 500-550 mg/m2 are safe but, when objective measures of cardiac function are used, it becomes apparent that degrees of cardiac failure occur at doses below this. We present here the case histories of two patients who developed very severe cardiac failure at cumulative doses well below 500 mg/m2 but who survived their initial cardiac illness due to aggressive intervention. In one case, the patient was successfully treated by orthotopic cardiac transplantation.",1994,10
1365,7835785,Ovarian endometrioid carcinoma and endometriosis developing in a postmenopausal breast cancer patient during tamoxifen therapy: a case report and review of the literature.,We present the first case of ovarian endometrioid carcinoma and endometriosis in a postmenopausal patient who was treated with tamoxifen for breast cancer. The association with prolonged unopposed estrogen-like stimulation with tamoxifen as a possible factor in the development of ovarian endometrioid carcinoma is discussed.,1994,12
1366,7854541,Multifocal inflammatory leukoencephalopathy associated with levamisole therapy.,"Cerebral demyelinating disease developed in a patient during adjuvant therapy with levamisole for malignant melanoma. This patient had no evidence of previous neurologic disease. Levamisole was administered for 5 weeks (total dose, 1,500 mg). Over a period of 3 weeks, the patient became progressively confused and ataxic. MRI with gadolinium enhancement demonstrated prominent multifocal enhancing white matter lesions. CSF examination revealed an inflammatory profile. After discontinuation of treatment with levamisole and a short course of corticosteroid therapy, the patient's condition dramatically improved. MRI also indicated improvement. Observations in our patient suggest that the leukoencephalopathy that developed in previously reported patients who received 5-fluorouracil and levamisole may have been caused at least partly by levamisole.",1995,2
1367,7865488,A case of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema by ethanolamine oleate.,"Endoscopic injection of sclerosing agents is a strategy for control of esophageal varix bleeding. Five percent solution of ethanolamine oleate(EO) has been used as sclerosing agent. It is well known that intravascular injection of oleic acid induces acute respiratory failure in animal models. However, EO-induced noncardiogenic pulmonary edema has not been reported in human. We report a case of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema developed after therapeutic trial of EO as sclerosing agent for esophageal varix.",1994,7
1368,788666,Gentamicin-associated acute renal failure.,"Five patients are described in whom only gentamicin sulfate appeared responsible for acute renal failure. Subjects received 1.2 to 2.88 gm over 12 to 18 days. All were over 45 years of age, and premorbid kidney abnormalities may have enhanced susceptibility to toxic effects of the drug. Renal failure appeared 8 to 17 days after beginning gentamicin therapy and was characterized by creatinine clearances 4 to 10 ml/min, urine to plasma creatinine ratios less than 20, urinary sodium concentrations 16 to 60 mEq/liter, proteinuria, and cylindruria. Oliguria was not observed and this feature may impair recognition of kidney damage. Clinical recovery required an average of 42 days and was complete in four of five patients. Gentamicin alone may be nephrotoxic and should be given with particular caution to the elderly and those with even mild kidney abnormalities.",1976,10
1369,7887138,A 15-year follow-up of phenytoin-induced unilateral gingival hyperplasia: a case report.,"INTRODUCTION-The aim of this case report is to present a 15-year follow-up of a patient with phenytoin (PHT) intoxication with unilateral gingival hyperplasia (GH). MATERIAL AND METHODS-A 50-year-old woman was followed-up for 15 years clinically and paraclinically after a heavy PHT intoxication. Her immunoglobulins in serum were checked on PHT and after 15 years treatment with carbamazepine. RESULTS-A gross mass of hyperplasia tissue found primarily in the left side of her mouth had disappeared and serum IgA which was subnormal at the first visit had normalized. CONCLUSION-It is possible to prevent GH from PHT treatment by intensive dental care, correct mouth hygiene and by change of treatment of carbamazepine.",1994,11
1370,7889679,Sclerodermatous syndrome after occupational exposure to herbicides--response to systemic steroids.,"We report a case of generalized cutaneous sclerosis associated with muscle and oesophageal involvement in a patient exposed to herbicides containing bromocil, diuron and aminotriazole. Treatment with oral prednisolone resulted in some improvement in the cutaneous signs, particularly over the face, trunk and proximal limbs. The considerable exposure to chemicals, time course and unusual pattern of organ involvement suggested a diagnosis of occupational scleroderma.",1994,11
1371,7893301,Hypokalemia after normal doses of neubulized albuterol (salbutamol).,The cases of two asthmatic patients who became hypokalemic after inhalation of normal doses of albuterol are presented. One patient was symptomatic and the other had only electrocardiographic changes. Both were treated successfully with oral potassium. Albuterol-induced hypokalemia and its potential cardiac toxicity are discussed briefly.,1995,3
1372,7897759,Propoxyphene-induced wide QRS complex dysrhythmia responsive to sodium bicarbonate--a case report.,Propoxyphene overdose is known to cause widening of the QRS complex on ECG. We report a case of a 54-year-old female who ingested approximately 100 propoxyphene hydrochloride tablets in a suicide attempt. She developed a wide complex dysrhythmia which responded to sodium bicarbonate therapy. Propoxyphene-induced wide complex dysrhythmia responsive to sodium bicarbonate therapy has not been previously reported in the literature.,1995,0
1373,7900744,Case report: mannitol nephrotoxicity syndrome: role of hemodialysis and postulate of mechanisms.,"High-dose intravenous mannitol infusion in various clinical settings may result in acute renal failure (ARF). This form of ARF is characteristically anuric and follows a distinctive clinical course. Most importantly, it occurs only after high doses of mannitol (> 200 g/day or cumulative dose of > 400 g in 48 hours), but not at lower doses. It appears that a low dose of mannitol acts as a renal vasodilator while high-dose mannitol is renal vasoconstrictor. Mannitol-induced ARF responds promptly to hemodialysis with rapid resolution of anuria and recovery of renal failure. This is a report of a case of anuric ARF after high-dose mannitol infusion for treatment of narrow-angle glaucoma that readily responded to acute hemodialysis. The literature is also reviewed for ARF associated with mannitol infusion in patients who received dialysis and those who did not receive dialysis; and the possible mechanism(s) of mannitol nephrotoxicity are discussed. Hemodialysis should be performed for rapid reversal of mannitol-induced ARF. Patients not treated with hemodialysis have increased morbidity and significant prolongation of their hospital course.",1995,4
1374,7907218,Two cases of long term dopamine D2 receptor blockade after depot neuroleptics.,Two patients with extrapyramidal side effects after the use of fluphenazine decanoate were evaluated by means of IBZM-SPECT. Dopamine D2 receptor occupancy 1.5 months after withdrawal still amounted to 83% and 50%. More attention should be focused on long term effects of neuroleptics.,1993,0
1375,7914463,Flumazenil reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation for a patient with severe pre-ECT anxiety.,"We describe various measures to reduce severe anxiety that interfered with much-needed maintenance electroconvulsive therapy in a 32-year-old man. Treatment with ketamine met with moderate success, and then large doses of lorazepam and midazalam were used. The potential anticonvulsant effect of these drugs was successfully reversed by the administration of intravenous flumazenil just prior to the treatments.",1994,3
1376,7919557,Cough induced by quinapril with resolution after changing to fosinopril.,"To report a case of chronic, nonproductive cough secondary to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril, with complete resolution after switching to another ACE inhibitor, fosinopril.
All relevant articles from January 1985 through February 1993 were identified, primarily through MEDLINE search and review of pertinent articles' bibliographies.
A 68-year-old woman developed a dry, irritating cough within one month of starting quinapril therapy for the treatment of essential hypertension. The patient was a nonsmoker with no respiratory illnesses. The cough continued for the duration of therapy with quinapril. One month after changing to fosinopril therapy, the patient reported complete resolution of the cough. She remains cough-free to date.
Cough induced by ACE inhibitors is a frequently documented adverse effect. It is severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in 1-10 percent of patients. The cough is considered to be a class-related adverse effect with cross-reactions between ACE inhibitors routinely reported. At this time, changing to another ACE inhibitor or additive therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs is not recommended. Discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor results in rapid alleviation of the cough, although this is not always necessary, as most patients may experience a cessation or decrease in cough. We report a case of cough following the administration of quinapril, with complete resolution after changing to the alternative ACE inhibitor fosinopril in a patient with essential hypertension.
Cough has been encountered commonly after the administration of ACE inhibitors. Frequency of cough is variable and although this complication has been described as a class effect, patients with a persistent, severe ACE inhibitor-induced cough may benefit from a trial of fosinopril therapy. This may be particularly useful in patients unable to tolerate an alternative class of antihypertensive agents.",1994,6
1377,7933665,Therapeutic strategy of nephrotic syndrome in patients over eighty.,"In the present paper, we report four very elderly patients (80 years of age or older) with primary nephrotic syndrome. In all patients, oral prednisolone (PSL) alternative day therapy was attempted and three patients responded very well (complete remission 2, partial remission 1). However, one patient exhibited no effect of PSL and died from acute oliguric renal failure in spite of aggressive measures including hemodialysis. Fracture of the femoral neck occurred in one patient during PSL therapy, although the relationship between the fracture and PSL therapy was uncertain. In addition to our reported cases, 5 cases of nephrotic syndrome in similar patients reported elsewhere are analyzed together with our cohort. PSL was commonly effective in inducing remission in very elderly patients (7 of 9 patients; 78%). Very elderly patients with nephrotic syndrome frequently suffer from oliguric renal failure, which has a potentially high mortality. Based on these data, we conclude that PSL therapy can ameliorate primary nephrotic syndrome in patients over the age of eighty years. However, the complications both of the disease and its treatment, (e.g., acute oliguric renal failure, hip fracture) must be carefully monitored.",1994,8
1378,7937287,Cefuroxime-induced acute renal failure.,"Although drug-induced allergic nephritis (DIAN) is one of the most common problems seen by nephrologists, its true frequency is probably underestimated. Diagnosis is often difficult and is typically only made in patients without another explanation for deteriorating renal function, and is often based solely on improvement after drug withdrawal. The diagnosis may be made more difficult due to lack of typical allergic symptoms, presence of other drugs, or confounding factors and equivocal noninvasive laboratory studies. The gold standard for diagnosis is renal biopsy, but it is only rarely performed during the acute phase of the reaction and is not without risk. It is important to keep a high index of suspicion with regard to DIAN since it is usually rapidly reversible. Failure to recognize it and discontinue the offending agents may result in unnecessary morbidity and occasionally, irreversible renal failure. In our patient, DIAN possibly was related to cefuroxime, but the patient did not experience associated allergic symptoms. The diagnosis was supported by the temporal course of renal deterioration during exposure to cefuroxime and improvement on its discontinuation; the pattern repeated with rechallenge. This is the first reported case of suspected DIAN due to cefuroxime.",0,0
1379,7946029,Basilar invagination and mid-line skeletal abnormalities due to in utero exposure to phenytoin.,"A case of basilar invagination which is thought to have arisen from the patient's intrauterine exposure to phenytoin is presented. The patient was treated surgically by foramen magnum decompression and occipito-cervical fusion, and by transoral resection of the clivus. His symptoms of brain stem compression were alleviated and the role of phenytoin in the production of his craniocervical abnormality is discussed.",1994,0
1380,7949255,Transient neurological disturbances induced by the chemotherapy of high-dose methotrexate for osteogenic sarcoma.,"Temporary neurologic abnormalities were observed in one out of 23 patients undergoing chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) for osteogenic sarcoma. This patient developed sequential symptoms including alternative hemiparesis, dysarthria and altered consciousness 5 days after the second course of HD-MTX (8 gm/m2 by 6 h continuous infusion) with leucovorin rescue. Laboratory evaluations disclosed normal electrolytes, hemograms and non-toxic serum MTX levels at the onset of the symptoms. Computed tomography of the brain was normal but electroencephalography showed focal theta and delta slow waves over the right temporal-parietal-occipital area. The neurological symptoms resolved completely within 72 h.",1994,8
1381,7953234,Case report: colonic stricture and fibrosis associated with high-strength pancreatic enzymes in a child with cystic fibrosis.,"High-strength pancreatic enzymes have recently been implicated as a cause of colonic strictures in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). We report a 5-year-old boy with CF who had a stricture of the hepatic flexure region with associated narrowing due to submucosal fibrosis of the transverse colon, secondary to high-lipase pancreatin therapy.",1994,9
1382,7962394,Acute pancreatitis associated with danazol treatment for endometriosis.,"Hypo-oestrogenic and anabolic/androgenic side-effects of danazol are well known by the gynaecologist and some of them are present in > 50% of patients being treated for endometriosis. Additionally, danazol produces hepatocellular damage in approximately 10% of women. The present report describes the first case of acute pancreatitis associated with danazol treatment of endometriosis.",1994,6
1383,7973922,Acyclovir neurotoxicity: clinical experience and review of the literature.,"Acyclovir produces neurologic symptoms that resemble extension of viral infection into the central nervous system. We discuss our observations in the cases of two patients with acyclovir neurotoxicity and review the findings of all previous reports in the English language literature. Systemic disease, most commonly renal dysfunction, preceded all 30 reported cases of acyclovir neurotoxicity. The most common symptoms were mental status disorder and involuntary movements. Measurement of serum acyclovir levels substantiated the diagnosis in only a subset of patients. Although all patients recovered, hemodialysis hastened the rate of recovery.",1994,12
1384,7978578,Response of a promethazine-induced coma to flumazenil.,"We report the first case of a patient in a promethazine-induced coma responding to treatment with flumazenil. A literature search conducted to determine the mechanism behind the antagonism of this overdose showed that promethazine interacts with receptors in the central nervous system. Sedative effects may, in fact, be mediated through the benzodiazepine receptor. We concluded that flumazenil can antagonize the sedative effects of promethazine at these receptors to return the patient to a wakeful state.",1994,11
1385,7986915,Amebic abscess of the spleen complicated by metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity: case report.,"We describe a patient with a liver abscess due to Entamoeba histolytica, in whom metronidazole therapy (total dose, 21 g over 14 days) was complicated by reversible deafness, tinnitus, and ataxia and who relapsed 5 months later with a splenic abscess. Two courses of tinidazole (the second in combination with percutaneous aspiration of the abscess) were required to achieve cure.",1994,8
1386,7991279,Actinomycin D associated hepatic veno-occlusive disease--a report of 2 cases.,"Until recently, actinomycin D (AMD), a cytotoxic antibiotic, was considered to cause little or no liver damage. There are now reports of liver failure following treatment of childhood cancers with AMD. This report describes the pathological changes in liver biopsy samples taken from 2 children who developed liver failure after combined chemotherapy for Wilms' tumor. The changes were those of nodular hyperplasia, sclerosis of terminal hepatic venules with associated zone 3 hemorrhagic necrosis, and sinusoidal fibrosis. These features were initially ascribed to the veno-occlusive disease caused by pyrrolizidine alkaloids, radiotherapy and some therapeutic drugs but have not been described in detail as a complication of AMD therapy. An additional feature peculiar to these 2 cases was the presence of unexplained extramedullary hematopoiesis.",1994,7
1387,7995508,Phenylpropanolamine-induced psychosis. Potential predisposing factors.,"Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) is a sympathomimetic drug contained in numerous over-the-counter and prescription decongestants and appetite suppressants. A range of adverse effects have been reported, including neuropsychiatric reactions in patients known to be taking recommended doses. Given that psychiatric symptoms are not included in the manufacturer's lists of adverse drug reactions, the incidence may be significantly higher. We report a cae of paranoid psychosis following use of a decongestant containing PPA and summarize the case report literature of psychiatric adverse effects to PPA in which doses were known and stated to be within recommended guidelines. A pattern of possible risk factors emerges from these reports. These may include 1) symptoms or history of mood spectrum disorder, 2) history of psychosis, 3) female sex, 4) family history of psychiatric disorder. The possibility that a higher incidence of adverse events occurs in a vulnerable population has not been systematically addressed, and seems called for. We recommend that physicians specifically inquire about patients' use of decongestants and diet aids. In half of the above cases, symptoms resolved without the use of antipsychotics.",1994,9
1388,8002140,Contact dermatitis due to budesonide: report of five cases and review of the Japanese literature.,"Contact allergy to corticosteroids has recently gained increased attention.
Five cases of contact dermatitis due to budesonide, a nonhalogenated steroid, are described. The Japanese literature was reviewed for reports on this allergy, and the occurrence due to budesonide was compared with that of other dermocorticosteroids.
Budesonide use can cause contact dermatitis.
Although budesonide may be beneficial because of its anti-inflammatory effects, clinicians should be alert to its potential for causing contact dermatitis.",1994,10
1389,8007037,Methemoglobinemia: an occupational hazard of phenylpropanolamine production.,"Two workers from the same factory presented to the same emergency department within six weeks of one another with moderate (Case 1) and severe (Case 2) methemoglobinemia. Subsequent investigation revealed that the factory produces phenylpropanolamine and that both patients, shortly before becoming ill, were inadvertently exposed to methyl nitrite, a critical reagent in this production. Although other nitrites induce methemoglobinemia, exposure to methyl nitrite during phenylpropanolamine production appears to be a new cause of occupational methemoglobinemia.",1994,0
1390,8013261,Occurrence of IDDM during interferon therapy for chronic viral hepatitis.,"We report a case of IDDM which occurred during interferon therapy for chronic hepatitis. A 31-year-old man intermittently received 2.5 x 10(8) units of alpha-IFN and 1 x 10(8) units of beta-IFN for treatment of chronic viral hepatitis type B. Four years after the beginning of IFN therapy, he acutely developed moderate hyperglycemia and severe ketonuria with positive islet cell antibody, and then 28 units/day of insulin injection was started. After the start of insulin therapy, there was a remission period for about 3 years but insulin-dependency recurred thereafter. The clinical course of this case indicates that IFN therapy precedes IDDM. During and after IFN therapy we should consider the possibility of occurrence of IDDM as well as other autoimmune diseases and observe the clinical course carefully.",1994,2
1391,8024670,Antiepileptic drug hypersensitivity syndrome: in vitro and clinical observations.,"Four patients who manifested symptoms of the antiepileptic drug (AED) hypersensitivity syndrome during therapy with carbamazepine are reported. In 3 patients, the syndrome was exacerbated after conversion of therapy to another antiepileptic drug with an aromatic ring chemical structure. In vitro lymphocyte transformation studies confirmed cross-reactivity to one or more aromatic AEDs in 3 patients. In all patients, discontinuation of aromatic AEDs resulted in resolution of symptoms and in 3 patients who required continued AED therapy, valproic acid was well tolerated.",1994,3
1392,8031432,Recurrent hypotension immediately after seizures in nortriptyline overdose.,"Cardiovascular deterioration after seizures in tricyclic overdose has long been suspected. The investigators studied a patient with a nortriptyline HCI level of 1,205 ng/mL who had four generalized grand mal seizures, each lasting between 60 and 90 seconds that were immediately followed by hypotension requiring norepinephrine support. When the seizures were controlled with midazolam, the hypotension subsided and norepinephrine was decreased. The metabolic acidosis associated with the seizures may have caused hypotension by direct cardiotoxicity, an increase in bioavailability of tricyclic antidepressant because of changes in protein binding, an alteration of the effects of tricyclic antidepressant on cardiac membrane sodium channels, or a combination of these mechanisms.",1994,7
1393,8034807,The use of methotrexate for treatment of psoriasis in patients with HIV infection.,"The use of methotrexate (MTX) has been contraindicated for treatment of severe psoriasis in HIV infection on the basis of six previously reported cases in which MTX appeared to potentiate opportunistic infections and accelerate HIV disease. We describe three HIV-infected patients who were given MTX for severe psoriatic arthritis. In two patients opportunistic infections did not develop. On the basis of survival data, it is not clear that use of MTX adversely affected the natural course of their HIV disease.",1994,8
1394,8038468,Possible drug interaction between warfarin and combination of levamisole and fluorouracil.,"To report a possible drug interaction between the combination of fluorouracil (5-FU), levamisole, and warfarin.
An elderly patient with chronic atrial fibrillation and prosthetic valve replacements had been taking warfarin 22.5 mg/wk. Following the diagnosis of colon cancer (Duke's classification D), a chemotherapy regimen of 5-FU and levamisole was started. Within four weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, the International Normalization Ratio (INR) increased from 3.04 to 39.56. Warfarin was discontinued and restarted at 7.5 mg/wk. Discontinuation of levamisole and 5-FU for a five-week period resulted in the INR falling to a subtherapeutic level. Reinstitution of the chemotherapeutic regimen once again led to an increase in INR.
A literature search showed no reports of an interaction between warfarin and levamisole. However, prolongation of 5-FU half-life and an increase in INR have been reported with the concurrent use of 5-FU and warfarin. Inhibition of the hepatic metabolism of warfarin by 5-FU and levamisole is the postulated mechanism of this drug interaction.
This case describes the clinically significant increase of INR in an elderly patient after adding a chemotherapy regimen of levamisole and 5-FU to a previous regimen of warfarin alone. The increasing incidence of both atrial fibrillation and colon cancer with age could potentially require the concomitant use of 5-FU, levamisole, and warfarin. Because of the potential severity of this interaction, close monitoring of INR and warfarin dosage adjustment is recommended in patients receiving warfarin along with levamisole and 5-FU.",1994,4
1395,8053440,Cholestatic liver disease with ductopenia (vanishing bile duct syndrome) after administration of clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.,"Two patients who developed cholestatic liver disease after exposure to antibiotics are described. One patient who received clindamycin had liver biopsy findings of marked cholestasis, portal inflammation, bile duct injury and bile duct paucity (ductopenia). A second biopsy after clinical improvement showed resolution of cholestasis but persistence of duct paucity. Three years later, treatment with ampicillin caused another episode of cholestatic hepatitis with cholestasis and duct paucity on rebiopsy. The second patient, who developed cholestasis after receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, had marked duct paucity in the liver biopsy. This is the first description, to our knowledge, of ductopenia apparently caused by clindamycin. Cross-reactivity between clindamycin and ampicillin is also demonstrated in one patient. This report documents that duct paucity may occur within 10 days of onset of jaundice and appears to be confined to ducts less than 0.03 mm in diameter.",1994,8
1396,8071504,Toxic optic neuropathy associated with ethambutol: implications for current therapy.,"Aside from the direct ocular manifestations of tuberculosis, significant vision loss can occur during treatment with agents that have potential ocular toxicities. Many thoracic specialists and eye care physicians consider these effects rare and readily reversible. With the alarming increase in incidence of tuberculosis in the United States over the past several years a review of anti-tuberculosis medications and their potential side effects is warranted.
A patient who developed dramatic, permanent vision loss after a 9-month course of treatment with ethambutol and isoniazid for pulmonary tuberculosis is presented. The medical and ophthalmic literature was reviewed for current use of these medications as well as for the reported incidence of visual side effects.
Ethambutol, and to a lesser extent isoniazid, are both implicated in the development of visually related side effects. There is documentation of ocular toxicity with ethambutol when administered at dosages generally pronounced as being safe. Controversy as to what constitutes a safe and effective dose of these medications still exists.
Any patient undergoing medical treatment for tuberculosis requires proper education concerning potential drug side effects. Routine ophthalmic observation for the development of optic neuropathy is strongly recommended for patients with significant risk factors that could increase the chance of side effects and those on longer treatment courses. Baseline and follow-up examinations should include: Snellen acuity, Farnsworth D-15 color testing, automated threshold perimetry and optic nerve head photography.",1994,5
1397,8083821,Zidovudine use in pregnancy: a report on 104 cases and the occurrence of birth defects.,"As more women of childbearing age are being identified as HIV infected, vertical transmission to the fetus and/or neonate is an increasingly significant therapeutic problem. Currently the use of zidovudine is one of the few specific measures available, and as a potentially teratogenic and fetotoxic agent, any decision for its use requires evaluation of the potential for fetal damage. In a series of 104 cases of intentional or inadvertent use of zidovudine at differing gestations in pregnancy, there were eight spontaneous first trimester abortions, eight therapeutic terminations, and eight cases of fetal abnormality occurring among a total of 88 cases where the pregnancy progressed. Analysis and correlation of antenatal data and drug therapy with individual cases failed to show any specific abnormality that could reasonably be attributed to zidovudine therapy. While not proving safety, these data add to previous smaller series with similar findings, thus lending tenuous support to the use of this agent. Continuing studies are required, particularly to clarify the possibility of long-term developmental defects.",1994,10
1398,8098286,Celiprolol pneumonitis.,"We report on a patient who developed hypersensitivity pneumonitis during treatment with the beta-blocker, celiprolol. The clinical picture was a severe alveolitis, with compromised gas exchange. Inadvertent subsequent rechallenge with celiprolol led to recurrence of the pneumonitis, 10 weeks after drug readministration. Again, the pneumonitis was fully reversible. Lymphocytes were elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage, and progressively normalized upon discontinuation of the drug. This case is reminiscent of pneumonitis to other beta-blockers, which are reviewed here.",1993,4
1399,8104147,Ibopamine-induced reversible leukopenia during treatment for congestive heart failure.,"Reversible leukopenia was documented in an 81-year-old woman treated with adjunctive ibopamine 100 mg t.i.d. for chronic congestive heart failure. Her antecedent medical history included stable, mild renal function impairment, mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, recurrent transient ischaemic attacks and cholelithiasis. The drugs concomitantly used were digoxin, isosorbide dinitrate, frusemide, urapidil and chlorthalidone in conjunction with oral potassium substitution. Upon withdrawal of ibopamine but continuation of all other drugs, the patient recovered from the blood dyscrasia within 5 days and showed resolution of symptoms. Measurements of protected isolation and selective intestinal decontamination were taken. No complications resulting from secondary infection occurred. After withdrawal of ibopamine and under continuation of all other concomitant medications her body weight continued to decrease during the following few days, her symptoms were alleviated and she was discharge to a nursing home.",1993,7
1400,812008,Grand mal seizures and acute intermittent porphyria. The problem of differential diagnosis and treatment.,"A 36-year-old white man had both acute intermittent porphyria and long-standing idiopathic grand mal seizures. Diphenylhydantoin apparently adversely affected both the clinical and biochemical parameters of the acute intermittent porphyria. Comparison of urinary levels of the porphyrin precursors, delta aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, under controlled diet conditions before and after withdrawal of diphenylhydantoin, showed that this drug accounted for approximately one-half of the porphyrin precursor excretion. Significant clinical improvement of the porphyria followed withdrawal of the diphenylhydantoin. Bromides appeared to be approximately as effective as diphenylhydantoin for seizure control in this patient.",1975,12
1401,8120934,Bromocriptine-induced schizophrenia.,"A 53-year-old male, without any prior history of psychosis, developed schizophrenia 4 days after starting low-dose bromocriptine therapy for a macroprolactinoma. Five days after discontinuation of this medication his mental status returned to normal. This case is reported in support of the dopamine hypothesis for the etiology of schizophrenia.",1993,9
1402,8124920,Concurrent acute megaloblastic anaemia and pneumonitis: a severe side-effect of low-dose methotrexate therapy during rheumatoid arthritis.,"In a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, we report the first simultaneous occurrence of two side effects of low-dose methotrexate: an acute megaloblastic anaemia and a pneumonitis. A combination of methotrexate suspension, folinic acid and corticosteroids led to recovery. The correlation between the haematologic and pneumologic toxicity is discussed.",1993,12
1403,8145359,Phenothiazine treatment and respiratory distress syndrome in a child.,"An 11-year-old boy who was treated with a relatively high dose of methotrimeprazine meleate (Levemepromazine) a phenothiazine antipsychotic drug, was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit suffering from respiratory distress syndrome. He required intensive treatment and support for 13 days. The persistent effects of methotrimeprazine meleate on various organs are typical of the prolonged biological action of the phenothiazine metabolites. The association of phenothiazine overdose and respiratory distress syndrome merits consideration.",1994,0
1404,8149366,Apomorphine and diphasic dyskinesia.,"We report on three observations of parkinsonian patients with levo-dopa-induced diphasic dyskinesias, who received subcutaneous apomorphine to reduce the duration of abnormal movements. Apomorphine was effective in reducing the duration of diphasic dyskinesias at doses higher than the threshold doses necessary to induce an ""on"" phase (mean increase: 43%). However, after a few months of treatment, apomorphine was ineffective in stopping abnormal movements, even when doses were increased. In two patients, apomorphine remained effective in the morning, but increased the intensity of the dyskinesias in the afternoon. Acute diurnal variations of the pharmacodynamic striatal response are suggested explanation for these clinical observations.",1994,2
1405,8151270,Fulminant hepatitis with severe lactate acidosis in HIV-infected patients on didanosine therapy.,"We report two cases of fulminant hepatic failure in HIV-1-infected patients treated with didanosine (ddI). Clinical manifestations including vomiting, diarrhoea and dyspnoea were identical in both cases. Biological data mainly revealed hepatic failure and lactic acidosis. Histological examination of liver biopsies showed diffuse microvesicular steatosis. The outcome was fatal in both patients. The only comparable case previously reported (Lai et al., 1991) showed close similarities in the clinical, biological and histological manifestations with microvesicular steatosis. This prompted us to suspect that ddI might be responsible for fulminant hepatitis in all three AIDS patients. This toxic effect may be added to the list of potential adverse events occurring during ddI therapy.",1994,4
1406,8157823,Generalized argyria after habitual use of AgNO3.,"Generalized argyria, the systemic dissemination and tissue deposition of silver-containing particles, is characterized by slate gray discoloration of skin, most pronounced in sun exposed areas. A 33-year-old woman visited our dermatologic clinic complaining of frequent oral ulceration for 10 years and generalized discoloration of her skin for 5 years. She had had her tongue painted with silver nitrate repeatedly 6 years ago for the treatment of oral ulcers. Physical examination showed slate gray discoloration of her skin, most pronounced on the face and neck. The oral mucosa, tongue, sclera, and conjunctiva also had a slightly blue-gray discoloration. Biopsy specimens from the oral mucosa and forearm revealed small brown-black granules scattered in the dermis and basal lamina of eccrine sweat glands, blood vessels, and hair follicles under the light microscope. Tiny black granules were most numerous in the basal laminae of vessels in electron microscopic observation. Energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDXA) confirmed that many of the granules contained silver.",1994,1
1407,8162401,Seizures associated with fluoxetine therapy.,"Fluoxetine is a relatively new antidepressant, reported to have minimal side-effects. Seizures associated with fluoxetine therapy are uncommon. The five cases reported so far are reviewed. A case of fluoxetine induced seizures, in a person with Down syndrome, is described.",1993,12
1408,8164831,Fluoxetine suppresses human cataplexy: a pilot study.,"We evaluated fluoxetine in six patients with poorly controlled cataplexy by beginning patients on a single 20 mg dose without any change in their current medications. Once benefit occurred, we discontinued or reduced other anticataplectic medication. Reduction in the number of cataplectic episodes per week after 20 weeks of treatment constituted the basis for efficacy determination. Patients experienced a mean reduction of 92% (a mean drop in frequency of 21.7 to 1.7 episodes per week). Although fluoxetine-induced headache occurred in one patient, the other five reported no side effects at the doses used. The results of this pilot study demonstrate that fluoxetine safely and effectively suppresses cataplexy and reduces the need for other, less desirable, anticataplectic agents.",1994,4
1409,8175330,Psoriasiform eruption induced by anticonvulsants.,"We present findings from three patients who experienced a psoriasiform eruption apparently due to the antiepileptic agents sodium valproate and carbamazepine. The causal relationship between the drug and the eruption has been based mainly on circumstantial evidence and is further strengthened by the positive result of one or two in vitro tests: the macrophage migration inhibition (MIF) test and the indirect rat mast cell degranulation (MCD) test. Sodium valproate and carbamazepine, antiepileptic drugs that are associated with a relatively low rate of adverse cutaneous reactions, should be added to the growing list of drugs that produce psoriasiform eruptions. A drug-induced psoriasiform eruption due to these drugs seems to be more common than previously reported. Physicians should be aware of this type of reaction. Early detection of these cases has practical importance since the identification and elimination of the causative drug is essential for therapy success.",1994,4
1410,8181372,Severe diffuse interstitial pneumonitis induced by carmustine (BCNU).,"We report a fatal case of acute interstitial pneumonitis in a patient treated with carmustine (BCNU) for a brain tumor. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed lymphocyte alveolitis with a low CD4/CD8 ratio (0.36), consistent with an immunoallergic phenomenon, rather than the most often evoked toxic hypothesis.",1994,5
1411,8186884,Electrical proarrhythmia with procainamide: a new ICD-drug interaction.,"A 78-year-old man with a transvenous cardioverter defibrillator system developed frequent shocks during oral procainamide therapy. Electrophysiologic evaluation demonstrated failure to terminate ventricular tachycardia with maximal energy shocks, but consistent termination by low energy discharges. Procainamide had no effect upon the defibrillation threshold. The failure of therapy with disopyramide and mexiletine to reproduce this observation suggests either a previously unreported electrophysiologic effect of, or idiosyncratic response to, procainamide.",1994,2
1412,8192712,Hyperammonemia secondary to valproic acid as a cause of lethargy in a postictal patient.,"Hyperammonemia has been described as a complication of valproic acid therapy but may often be overlooked as a cause of lethargy in the postictal patient who presents to the emergency department. We present the case of a postictal patient with lethargy, hyperammonemia, otherwise normal liver function tests, and a therapeutic valproic acid level. Based on our experience and on previously published data, serum ammonia levels appear to be indicated in all ED patients on valproic acid therapy who present with altered mental status. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been reported previously in the emergency medicine literature.",1993,3
1413,8197046,Central nervous system toxicity associated with meperidine use in hepatic disease.,"Meperidine-associated central nervous system (CNS) excitatory toxicities are believed to be caused by accumulation of the active metabolite normeperidine. Normeperidine is eliminated by the kidneys and accumulates in patients with renal insufficiency, sickle cell disease, and cancer. In patients with cirrhosis, the metabolism of meperidine is decreased, leading to accumulation of the parent drug and possible CNS depressive effects similar to hepatic encephalopathy. Although the elimination of normeperidine is decreased as well in these patients, the ratio of normeperidine to meperidine is generally low, and the narcotic effects of meperidine usually predominate. This is the first reported case of CNS excitatory toxicities in a patient with alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, and normal renal function. Administration of multiple doses of meperidine in patients with hepatic disease should be discouraged.",0,0
1414,8207519,Treatment of high-dose intrathecal morphine overdose. Case report.,"The case is reported of a 45-year-old woman who was being treated for chronic back and right leg pain with intrathecal morphine administered via a subcutaneous continuous-infusion device. She received an accidental 450-mg bolus injection of morphine intrathecally and developed hypertension, status epilepticus, intracerebral hemorrhage, and respiratory failure. Treatment with continuous intravenous naloxone infusion, lumbar catheter drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, and control of hypertension and status epilepticus resulted in an excellent outcome with return to neurological baseline. Care providers who refill pump reservoirs with morphine must be knowledgeable about these devices and the life-threatening consequences associated with errors in refilling them. This case describes the complications and successful treatment of high-dose intrathecal morphine overdose.",1994,7
1415,8222875,Pulmonary hemorrhage as a clinical manifestation of hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with mitomycin C therapy.,"Mitomycin C (MMC) is an alkylating agent that has been recently associated with the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Pulmonary impairment in the HUS is rarely reported in the literature, and no reports of pulmonary hemorrhage, as a clinical feature of the HUS, have been documented. We describe two women who developed HUS after MMC therapy and presented massive pulmonary bleeding. Pulmonary hemorrhage is an uncommon feature in the HUS, and seems to appear especially in the HUS associated with MMC therapy. It is extremely resistant to standard treatment, and confers a poor prognosis for this disease.",0,0
1416,8239963,Clonidine-induced bradycardia in patients with spinal cord injury.,"Clonidine is being used increasingly for treatment of spasticity in patients with spinal cord injury. Though hypotension, dry mouth, and constipation are well-documented possible adverse effects, the possibility of clonidine-induced bradycardia is less well recognized and is rare. This report describes a patient who developed spasticity following a traumatic spinal cord injury. After clonidine was initiated, the patient's spasticity improved. However, he developed significant bradycardia. Once clonidine was discontinued, the resting heart rate returned to normal. This case illustrates an unusual adverse effect of clonidine. Possible mechanisms by which clonidine decreases spasticity are described, probable mechanisms of induced bradycardia are reviewed, and specific treatment recommendations for the use of clonidine in spinal cord injured patients are presented.",1993,11
1417,8244201,Hyperkalaemia with renal tubular dysfunction by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with lymphoid malignancy.,"Hyperkalaemia with renal tubular dysfunction by oral therapy of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (co-trimoxazole) is described in 2 elderly Japanese patients with lymphoid malignancy, who developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and improved. A high dose of cotrimoxazole induced hyperkalaemia with the elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea, and increased urinary N-acetyl glucosaminase after several days of the drug administration in these patients; one patient became unconscious. Discontinuation of co-trimoxazole normalized serum potassium level and symptoms. A repeated low dose of the drug induced hyperkalaemia. Before the treatment of co-trixomazole, their serum levels of creatinine showed upper limits of normal ranges. In the present study, our cases suggested that patients receiving a high dose of co-trimoxazole should be evaluated for these potential complications during a course of treatment, particularly in elderly patients with preexisting renal dysfunction.",1993,0
1418,8250714,Neurologic degeneration associated with nitrous oxide anesthesia in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.,"Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) is an integral component of two biochemical reactions in man: the conversion of L-methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A and the formation of methionine by methylation of homocysteine. The transmethylation reaction is essential to DNA synthesis and to the maintenance of the myelin sheath by the methylation of myelin basic protein. Active vitamin B12 contains cobalt in its reduced form (Co+). Nitrous oxide produces irreversible oxidation to the Co++ and Co forms that renders vitamin B12 inactive. Five cases (four from the literature and one new case) are presented in which patients unsuspected of having vitamin B12 deficiency developed subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord following nitrous oxide anesthesia. Patients with vitamin B12 deficiency are exceedingly sensitive to neurologic deterioration following nitrous oxide anesthesia. If unrecognized, the neurologic deterioration becomes irreversible and may result in death.",1993,12
1419,8253700,Association of fluoxetine and return of sexual potency in three elderly men.,"Fluoxetine, a highly specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has been reported to cause sexual dysfunction in a minority of patients. Although priapism has been associated with other serotonergic antidepressants, no published reports have correlated restoration of sexual potency with use of fluoxetine.
The case histories of three geriatric patients treated with fluoxetine for depression or obsessive compulsive disorder are presented.
Three patients with histories of impotence experienced a return of sexual potency after treatment with fluoxetine. In two of the cases, the patients had documented histories of vascular disease, which their internists had identified as the cause of their impotence. The improvement in sexual response was seemingly unrelated to abatement of depression or obsessive compulsive disorder, and there was no description of priapism by any of the patients.
Sexual side effects of fluoxetine may be more variable than previously thought. Animal models showing paradoxical or opposing responses to serotonin-enhancing agents may apply to human sexual functioning as well.",1993,8
1420,8255797,Captopril-induced bone marrow suppression in two cardiac patients with trisomy 21.,"Neutropenia is an infrequent complication following administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. Most reports have been in adult patients, with rare reports in the pediatric population. We report two cases of neutropenia following captopril use in cardiac patients with trisomy 21. As this was not seen in patients without Down's syndrome, we postulate that patients with trisomy 21 have bone marrow which is ""at risk"" for suppression, and, thus warrant close evaluation while on such medications.",1993,10
1421,8260059,Can magnesium sulfate therapy impact lactogenesis?,"This case report describes a patient who ingested magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) for approximately four days as a treatment for pregnancy-induced hypertension. Stage II lactogenesis was delayed until the tenth postpartum day at which point the patient's breasts became fully engorged. No explanation for this delay was found, other than the possibility that magnesium sulfate treatment impeded lactogenesis. Implications for professionals who care for lactating women are discussed.",1993,12
1422,8266863,Severe flare-up in a prostate cancer patient treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue depot.,"A 65-year-old man with advanced prostate cancer was treated with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analogue. Four days after the initial injection of 3.6 mg of goserelin acetate, severe dyspnea developed due to worsening pleuritis carcinomatosa, which was considered as a flare-up. Chest drainage was required to save his life. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of treatment to prevent tumor flare during LH-RH analogue therapy.",1993,10
1423,8276031,Imidazoline intoxication in children.,"A 15-month-old girl with rhinopharyngitis was treated with a nasal solution containing the imidazoline derivative naphazoline. She rapidly developed profound CNS depression with stupor, hypothermia, hypoventilation and bradycardia. All symptoms disappeared within 24 h. The symptomatology of 18 other paediatric cases of naphthylimidazoline exposure reported to the Belgian National Poison Centre, is also discussed. Imidazoline intoxication due to overdose or accidental ingestion but also after normal therapeutic usage is frequent in children. It can cause severe CNS depression, especially in very young children. For these reasons vasoconstrictor imidazoline containing solutions should be prescribed with caution and kept out of reach of children.",1993,11

The results and the importance of serial neuropsychological examinations after such complications in three children with ALL are presented. All patients showed marked aphasia and other cognitive deficits. Recovery was complete in two of three children.",0,0
1425,8301877,Myoclonus and seizures in a patient with parkinsonism: induction by levodopa and its confirmation on SEPs.,"A 68-year-old woman with parkinsonism showed cortical myoclonus and seizures under antiparkinsonian medication. Myoclonus was induced and enhanced by L-dopa, developing into generalized seizures. EEG was abnormal and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) showed giant SEPs, transcortical reflex (C reflex) and jerk locked potentials. Myoclonus and seizures disappeared after discontinuation of L-dopa and the introduction of valproate sodium (VPA). We described the occurrence of L-dopa-induced myoclonus and seizures in a case of parkinsonism with its SEPs findings.",1993,9
1426,8308511,Uses and safety of acyclovir in pregnancy.,"Acyclovir, an antiviral nucleoside analogue, is a widely used agent highly specific for herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viruses. Unintended exposure to acyclovir early in pregnancy, which is not uncommon, may cause excessive maternal and physician anxiety. This drug has not been studied prospectively in large numbers of pregnant women and lacks the Food and Drug Administration's approval for gestational use unless benefits clearly outweigh potential fetal harm. However, data published since acyclovir became available do not indicate increased adverse effects related to its use in pregnancy, especially if prescribed in selected situations, such as disseminated primary herpes simplex infections or maternal varicella pneumonia. This article reports the impact of inadvertent acyclovir exposure on a woman during the first trimester of pregnancy and reviews the literature on acyclovir's pharmacology, safety profile, and potential uses during pregnancy.",1994,2
1427,8313300,Regression of thyrotoxic ophthalmopathy following lithium withdrawal.,"The case of a bipolar patient who developed thyrotoxicosis with severe exophthalmos while on lithium therapy is described. The patient had required two surgical decompressions of the right orbit to relieve pressure, which occurred secondary to progression of the exophthalmos, and was scheduled for further surgery. Lithium therapy was discontinued because of poor compliance to the medication and intolerable polyuria. The exophthalmos improved dramatically within 72 hours of the withdrawal of lithium. A severe form of exophthalmos resulting from lithium therapy has not been described in the literature. The case described here adds to the body of information about the possible causes of thyrotoxic ophthalmopathy.",1993,12
1428,8316494,Severe abdominal pain in low dosage clofazimine.,"We describe a 41 yr old leprosy patient treated for 10 yrs with clofazimine who underwent laparotomy for severe abdominal pain. At surgery, the only significant findings were that the coeliac lymph nodes were enlarged and stained purplish black as were the omentum and the intraperitoneal fat. No other cause of abdominal pain was identified. On histological examination, reddish-purple crystals were identified at frozen section but not in the paraffin sections.",1993,1
1429,8329789,Amphotericin B overdose in pediatric patients with associated cardiac arrest.,"To report the first five cases of amphotericin B overdose with secondary cardiac complications in a pediatric population. Treatment is also presented.
Hospital.
Two infants and three children inpatients receiving amphotericin B.
Cardiac complications were observed in five pediatric patients who received between 4.6 and 40.8 mg/kg/d of amphotericin B. Cardiac arrest occurred in all patients, and four patients died. A detailed description of the cardiac event is provided for one patient who was on a cardiac monitor during the adverse reaction. Hydrocortisone prophylaxis and verapamil therapy were the primary therapies used in patient 1 (the only survivor). Evaluation of the literature provides substantial evidence for the use of hydrocortisone in prevention of cardiac arrhythmias.
Amphotericin B overdose can be fatal in children and infants. The presentation in humans appears similar to that in dogs where cardiac arrhythmias occurred at doses of 5-15 mg/kg. Hydrocortisone may decrease the incidence of mortality associated with cardiac arrhythmias in children receiving amphotericin B overdoses. Animal studies are necessary to evaluate this observation and potential disadvantages of hydrocortisone usage.",1993,6
1430,8340162,De novo hypertension after liver transplantation.,"Hypertension develops in most patients after transplantation when immunosuppression is based on cyclosporine and prednisone. The pathogenesis appears to be multifactorial but involves rapidly rising vasoconstrictor tone in renal and systemic vascular beds. Much of this tone reflects abnormal vascular function, characterized by impaired prostacyclin and EDRF effects, in conjunction with increased vasoconstriction due to endothelin and possibly other factors. Effective management of the transplant recipient depends on preventing excessive vasoconstriction, usually with calcium channel blocking agents.",1993,8
1431,834512,"Sudden death in an infant from methemoglobinemia after administration of ""sweet spirits of nitre"".","The administration of ""sweet spirits of nitre"" (4% ethyl nitrite CH3CH2ONO in 70% ethyl alcohol) was followed by acute methemoglobinemia and severe anoxic metabolic acidosis in infant twins, Methylene blue administration reversed methemoglobinemia in both, but one twin died from the consequences of hypoxemia. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and methemoglobin reductase determinations were normal for age. This medicine is available without prescription and contains the potent oxidant ethyl nitrite. In infants with sudded death or onset of cyanosis, appropriate toxicological and historical information should be obtained.",1977,2
1432,8345435,Hepatotoxic effects in a child receiving valproate and carnitine.,L-Carnitine supplementation has been recommended to prevent the fatal hepatotoxic effects associated with valproic acid.

1433,8360712,Delayed neurotoxicity of intraventricular interleukin-2: a case report.,"A case is reported of a 40 year old woman treated with intraventricular IL-2 for leptomeningeal disease who developed progressive cognitive dysfunction. This deterioration started 3 months post-treatment and worsened over the ensuing 4 years. MRI revealed white matter abnormalities that were not present on the pretreatment scan. Although free of disease, the patient has a subcortical dementia and is unable to work. The potential for progressive brain injury and subsequent disability related to intraventricular IL-2 therapy is discussed.",1993,3
1434,8363533,Lithium-associated transient thyrotoxicosis in 4 Chinese women with autoimmune thyroiditis.,"Four Chinese female patients who suffered from manic-depressive disorder and underlying autoimmune thyroiditis developed transient episodes of thyrotoxicosis during maintenance lithium therapy. Endocrinologically speaking, three of them had ""Hashitoxicosis"", while the other had silent lymphocytic thyroiditis. Albeit rare among Western patients, such lithium-associated thyroid dysfunctions appeared to be more likely to occur in Hong Kong Chinese. They seemed to involve multiple aetiological factors, such as autoimmune thyroid disease, the toxic and immunomodulatory roles of lithium and perhaps genetic and dietary factors. Because of their self-limiting nature, the importance of avoiding unnecessary and potentially deleterious antithyroid treatment is emphasised.",1993,6
1435,8375752,A recently recognized entity associated with the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia: the retinoic acid syndrome.,"All-trans-retinoic acid is an effective induction treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Although retinoic acid is well tolerated by the majority of patients with this disease, a potentially fatal complication of this kind of treatment has been reported: ""the retinoic acid syndrome"". We describe this syndrome, which occurred in one of our patients and was successfully treated by the administration of dexamethasone.",0,0
1436,8384030,Foscarnet-induced severe hypomagnesemia and other electrolyte disorders.,"To report a case of possible foscarnet-induced severe hypomagnesemia and other electrolyte disorders.
An AIDS patient experienced an exacerbation of cytomegalovirus retinitis and was treated with foscarnet. The patient experienced muscle twitches, tremulousness, and anxiety on day 17 of foscarnet therapy. Laboratory results indicated hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia. After electrolyte supplementation and discontinuation of foscarnet, the symptoms resolved and laboratory indices returned to normal.
Electrolyte disorders associated with foscarnet are reviewed. Severe hypomagnesemia occurred in this patient and published literature is highlighted. In addition, known and/or possible mechanisms of the disorders are discussed.
It is probable that foscarnet contributed to the electrolyte disorders and symptomatology in this patient. Electrolytes must be monitored frequently during foscarnet therapy. Also, concomitant therapy with antianxiety medications that may mask the symptoms of electrolyte disorders should be undertaken with caution.",1993,3
1437,8396491,"Interference with the cortisol axis by the microtubule antagonist, CPH82.","Treatment with CPH 82, a mixture of two benzylidated podophyllotoxin glycosides, has been shown to improve inflammatory activity in patients with RA. The drug has few side effects but some patients have developed clinical features of Cushing's syndrome. We studied the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in two female patients before and during treatment with CPH82. The results clearly demonstrate that CPH82 was associated with suppression of the endogeneous production of ACTH and cortisol with a concomitant paradoxical picture of clinical hypercortisolism. These observations suggest that CPH82 has glucocorticoid receptor agonistic effects.",1993,9
1438,8404753,Carbamazepine-induced tics.,"A variety of movement disorders are known to occur in association with carbamazepine (CBZ) therapy in adults and children, but development of tics has been described infrequently and only in patients with underlying Tourette's syndrome or other movement disorders. We report 3 children with epilepsy who developed facial motor tics after initiation of CBZ for complex partial seizures. All 3 had documented CBZ blood levels in the therapeutic range at the time, and none had other symptoms or signs of clinical intoxication. Neurologic examinations were normal in 2 and showed developmental delay of expressive language in the third. Brain imaging was normal in all. After development of the tics in 2, CBZ was continued at the same or higher dose, and the tics abated and then ceased spontaneously < or = 6 months. In the third child, the tics ceased after CBZ discontinuation. These cases demonstrate that CBZ can induce simple motor tics in children. These idiosyncratic reactions may be transient and do not always necessitate drug discontinuation.",0,0
1439,8430717,Acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity: concentration-side effect relationship in acyclovir overdose.,"To investigate the concentration-side effect relationship in a patient with severe acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity and to summarize the information available in the literature about central nervous system side effects due to acyclovir.
Repeated blood samples were drawn in a patient with severe acyclovir overdose who developed coma and nonoliguric renal failure. The acyclovir levels measured by radioimmunoassay were related to the level of consciousness.
We measured the highest acyclovir serum levels reported so far (229.9 mumol/L = 51.8 mg/L). Impairment of consciousness developed with a remarkable temporal delay of 24 to 48 hours after occurrence of peak serum concentrations and resolved with a comparable delay after reaching the therapeutic range (anticlockwise hysteresis). Six days after discontinuation of the drug, central nervous system symptoms had resolved, and, 4 days later, renal function returned to pretreatment values.
The observation that neurotoxicity developed with a delay of 24 to 48 hours after acyclovir peak serum concentrations could explain the wide range of acyclovir levels reported in similar cases. Single drug level measurements may therefore be of little diagnostic value. Since toxicity develops with a remarkable delay, early removal of the drug (by hemodialysis) could possibly prevent central nervous toxicity.",1993,2
1440,8435665,Fatal eosinophilia myalgia syndrome in a marrow transplant patient attributed to total parenteral nutrition with a solution containing tryptophan.,"A 16-year-old white male with acute biphenotypic leukemia developed evidence of the eosinophilia myalgia syndrome associated with total parenteral nutritional support with solutions containing tryptophan, which were given during his initial induction chemotherapy and also after autologous marrow transplantation. He developed pronounced eosinophilia and a vasculitic skin rash, myalgias of the abdomen, upper trunk, and neck, and died of respiratory distress with no evidence of an infectious etiology. Autopsy revealed diffuse vasculitis involving the heart, lungs, kidneys, testes, spleen, liver, skin, gut wall and marrow with neuritis of gut wall nerves and ganglia. Thus, the eosinophilia myalgia syndrome can be associated with parenteral tryptophan administration.",1993,2
1441,8438851,Rhabdomyolysis associated with the use of intravenous vasopressin.,"A patient with acute esophageal variceal bleeding developed fatal rhabdomyolysis during treatment with a continuous intravenous infusion of vasopressin. Signs of ischemia, including mottling of skin and painful extremities, preceded the development of the characteristic electrolyte abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias. No other recognized causes of rhabdomyolysis were identified on retrospective review of the hospital course. There are several factors which might promote a peripheral ischemic response to vasopressin in the bleeding cirrhotic patient, including altered resting hemodynamics, increased resting sympathetic tone, impaired vasodilation as a compensatory response to vasopressin, and reduced hepatic drug clearance. Idiosyncratic factors involving vasopressin receptor affinity and distribution, vasopressin-associated vasodilation in some vascular beds, and the effect of vasopressin on the renin-angiotensin system may further contribute to impaired tissue perfusion. These multiple overlapping factors probably lead to rhabdomyolysis in a minority of patients receiving vasopressin infusion.",1993,3
1442,8442800,First trimester disulfiram exposure: report of two cases.,"Disulfiram has been used effectively to deter alcohol consumption in patients with a history of alcohol abuse. Its use in reproductive age women has become increasingly common in recent years, intensifying the risk of fetal exposure. Nonspecific but significant abnormalities have been described in the infants of women treated with disulfiram in the first trimester of their pregnancies. Based on these data, authors have previously exposure is confirmed despite a lack of any pattern to the defects reported. We report the outcomes of two pregnancies with first trimester disulfiram exposure. In both cases, the timing and dose of disulfiram was known. In one case, disulfiram was the only potential teratogen exposed to the fetus. Both neonates were normal at birth and have shown subsequent normal development. This report suggests that the poor prognosis previously given to fetuses exposed to disulfiram in the first trimester may not be warranted.",1993,1
1443,8445549,Pemphigus vulgaris precipitated by glibenclamide therapy.,"Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a rare but potentially fatal autoimmune bullous disorder which frequently affects the oral mucosa. Although the essential cause of PV is unclear, its onset has occasionally been associated with drug therapy, in particular penicillamine. The patient described in this paper was a 78-year-old diabetic man who developed oral lesions of PV following institution of glibenclamide therapy.",1993,2
1444,8452107,Piritrexim-induced pulmonary toxicity.,"We describe a patient with transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis who developed respiratory dysfunction and an abnormal chest x-ray with diffuse interstitial opacities while on chemotherapy with piritrexim, a methotrexate analog. Drug discontinuation resulted in complete resolution of the clinical and radiographic picture. The pulmonary toxicity is probably induced by piritrexim.",1993,4
1445,8461228,Acceleration of ventricular response to atrial flutter after intravenous adenosine.,"Adenosine may be of therapeutic and diagnostic value in the emergency management of arrhythmias. It causes transient atrioventricular nodal block and thus ends paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias that involve the atrioventricular node. Also, it may uncover underlying atrial arrhythmias by slowing the ventricular response. Its duration of action is brief and serious adverse effects have not been reported. A 12 year old patient with atrial flutter is presented, in whom intravenous adenosine was followed by acceleration of the heart rate to a potentially dangerous arrhythmia.",1993,3
1446,8467620,Lymphoma developing in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis taking methotrexate.,"We report one case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a patient, with a 30-year history of rheumatoid arthritis, taking low dose methotrexate weekly over a 10-month period. The mild immunosuppression that occurs with methotrexate therapy probably places patients with rheumatoid arthritis at added risk of developing lymphoproliferative diseases, but coincidence cannot be excluded.",1993,3
1447,847572,Hepatotoxicity of paracetamol enhanced by ingestion of alcohol: report of two cases.,Two fatal cases of poisoning by paracetamol are described. Both patients were heavy imbibers of alcohol and both had swallowed less paracetamol that that generally regarded as a lethal dose. The biochemistry of paracetamol hepatotoxicity is outlined and the increased susceptibility of alcoholic patients to the hepatotoxic effects of paracetamol is remarked upon. Recent trends in the treatment of acute paracetamol poisoning are mentioned.,1977,2
1448,8485005,Complete regression of iatrogenic Kaposi's sarcoma due to corticosteroid treatment in a patient with tubercular pericarditis. A case report.,"We report a case of drug-induced Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) on the sole of the right foot in a 71-year-old man, treated for 6 months with corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone 25 mg/day) for pericardial effusion. After corticosteroid withdrawal, a tuberculin skin test became strongly positive and pericardial effusion was considered to be of tubercular origin. The patient remained constantly HIV negative during 14 months of follow-up. Seven months after continuous antitubercular treatment, the KS nodules regressed spontaneously and finally disappeared. Histological studies confirmed the diagnosis of KS and documented its complete regression. Laboratory investigation confirmed prior exposure to CMV, EBV and HSV and suggested drug-induced immunological suppression. Analysis of the HLA system revealed the positivity of locus DR5, associated with classical KS. This case report underscores the relationship between genetic background, environmental factors, drug-induced immunosuppression and the evolution of this peculiar neoplasm.",0,0
1449,8496127,Acute dystonic reaction with low-dose pimozide.,"It is essential to recognize individual susceptibility to neuroleptic-induced side effects for treatment guidelines. This paper reports on a 6.9-year-old autistic male who developed repeated episodes of acute dystonic reactions associated with pimozide administration at the doses of 0.096 mg/kg/day and 0.032 mg/kg/day and 32 hours following pimozide withdrawal, as well as during subsequent thioridazine administration. It draws the clinician's attention to unusual susceptibility to extrapyramidal side effects and suggests that if a child shows this type of susceptibility to one neuroleptic, he/she may react similarly to other neuroleptics as well.",1993,5
1450,8503421,Cholesterol crystal embolization-associated renal failure after therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator.,"We report the occurrence of renal failure due to cholesterol crystal embolization following thrombolytic therapy with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). No invasive vascular procedure had been performed. Although there is one case report of cholesterol crystal embolization following t-PA therapy with only extrarenal manifestations (N Engl J Med 321:1270, 1989), this is the first reported case of atheroembolic acute renal failure following t-PA therapy.",1993,6
1451,8520081,Use of haloperidol infusions to control delirium in critically ill adults.,"To describe and discuss the use of continuous intravenous infusions of haloperidol to treat severe delirium and agitation in 3 intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
Three severely agitated patients in ICU did not respond to conventional therapy with opiates, benzodiazepines, and intermittent intravenous doses of haloperidol. In each case, control was achieved rapidly after initiation and titration of a continuous haloperidol infusion. Two patients had a history of schizophrenia. No adverse effects attributable to therapy were identified.
Haloperidol is often used in the ICU for control of severe agitation, even in patients without a psychiatric history. It usually is given by bolus intravenous injection, sometimes in high doses (> 5 mg), even though that is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Intravenous haloperidol is generally well tolerated, but multiform ventricular tachycardia has been reported. Experience with continuous haloperidol infusions is growing, and it appears to be an effective method for control of severe agitation or delirium. In our experience and in other limited published data, adverse effects are rare, but prolongation of the QT interval has occurred and multiform ventricular tachycardia is likely a risk.
In selected patients, a continuous infusion of haloperidol may be a useful alternative for control of agitation and delirium. Close monitoring for QT prolongation or rhythm disturbances is mandatory.",0,0
1452,8523340,How low can you go? Use of very low dosage of gold in patients with mucocutaneous reactions.,"We identified a group of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were sensitive to both the beneficial and the side effects of intramuscular (im) gold treatment and whose disease was well controlled with doses of gold between 2 mg every 6 weeks and 5 mg weekly. We describe the clinical course of these patients and their management aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of gold therapy.
Patients successfully treated with maintenance doses of im gold (< 20 mg/mo and not more than 10 mg/dose) were identified by chart review. Clinic records were reviewed to extract clinical and laboratory data.
The population consisted of 11 female and 2 male patients with RA. Eleven were seropositive and 2 had Felty's syndrome. All developed mucocutaneous side effects within 20 weeks of beginning im gold therapy, at a time when RA had improved markedly compared to pretreatment status. Side effects recurred with sequential dosage adjustments so that doses > 10 mg were not tolerated. Side effects were managed by temporary discontinuation of gold until side effects resolved and resumption of treatment using usually 50% lower dosage. When side effects recurred the dosage was reduced further by 50%. Final maintenance dose was 2 mg every 4 weeks in 1 patient, 2 mg weekly in 1, 3 mg weekly in 3, 5 mg monthly in 1, 10 mg every 3 weeks in 2, 10 mg every 4 weeks in 2, 10 mg every 6 weeks in 1, and 5 mg weekly in 2 patients. All patients improved and 6 are in complete remission. Mean duration of therapy was 5.5 yrs.
The minimum effective dose of im gold is not known. Dose and dose intervals should be individualized for optimal benefits and tolerability.",1995,9
1453,85289,Anterior spinal artery syndrome--a complication of cervical intrathecal phenol injection.,"Spinal nerve block by intrathecal phenol-glycerine infusion is commonly employed for relief of severe pain in terminal carcinomatosis and, frequently, a dramatic regional anesthetic effect is achieved. However, nerve block by this procedure may in very rare instances give rise to serious complications. We have seen a case of terminal malignant melanoma in which clinical manifestations, indicative of anterior spinal artery syndrome, developed following the injection of 0.3 ml of 10% phenol-glycerine into the cervical subarachnoid space at the C4--C5 level for the control of severe right arm pain. This report describes the clinical course of the patient over a period of 4 months after the nerve block and the post-mortem findings along with a brief review of the literature.",1979,2
1454,8530331,Risperidone versus clozapine in the treatment of psychosis in six patients with Parkinson's disease and other akinetic-rigid syndromes.,"We report six cases of psychosis in patients with akinetic-rigid syndromes who were treated with risperidone.
Five of the six patients experienced intolerable exacerbation of parkinsonism. Four subsequently did well on clozapine therapy. One patient required nursing home placement and a feeding gastrostomy as a result of the worsening parkinsonism during risperidone treatment, but was able to return home and have the gastrostomy removed after switching from risperidone to clozapine. Two of the five patients who worsened motorically also developed encephalopathy during risperidone treatment; the encephalopathy resolved when the patients were switched to clozapine treatment. Only one patient, the youngest, did well on risperidone therapy.
We believe that risperidone is not a substitute for clozapine in treating psychosis in parkinsonian patients and should be used with caution.",1995,12
1455,8551001,Azathioprine-induced myelosuppression due to thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency in a patient with autoimmune hepatitis.,"Azathioprine can cause severe myelosuppression. The inherited activity of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase has been recently recognised as a major factor in the susceptibility to myelosuppression. Thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency occurs at a frequency of one in 300 and is associated with profound myelosuppression after a short course of azathioprine. Very low thiopurine methyltransferase activity represents the TPMTL/TPMTL genotype, and can be detected before therapy with azathioprine is started. We describe the first documented case of azathioprine-induced severe myelosuppression due to thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency in autoimmune liver disease. The azathioprine dose was low (1 mg/kg) and pancytopenia occurred after 56 days therapy. It would be advisable to measure thiopurine methyltransferase activity before patients with autoimmune hepatitis are exposed to azathioprine.",1995,9
1456,8570441,Nabumetone-associated interstitial nephritis.,"An 84-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for progressive edema and decreased urine output. She had been taking nabumetone for 6 months, but had discontinued the agent 2 weeks before admission due to progressive edema. On admission she had 2-3+ pitting edema. Her serum electrolytes were sodium 122 mEq/L, potassium 5.9 mEq/L, chloride 93 mEq/L, and carbon dioxide 19 mEq/L. A urinalysis was significant for protein 3061 mg/dl, ketones 15 mg/dl, blood 2+, leukocytes 26-50/high-power field, and a protein:creatinine ratio 24.9. The serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations were 2.7 mg/dl and 70 mg/dl, respectively. Throughout hospitalization the patient underwent aggressive diuresis. She developed congestive heart failure, and hemodialysis was initiated. A renal biopsy specimen on hospital day 9 showed tubular damage with minimal glomerular changes consistent with a diagnosis of nonsteroidal agent-induced nephropathy. On day 13, a 24-hour urine collection had a protein excretion of 3151 mg. Although the patient recovered from her renal failure (creatinine clearance 43 ml/min), the nephrotic syndrome persisted (13 g protein/day). The patient developed infectious complications and died on hospital day 32.",0,0
1457,8579054,Acute myeloid leukemia evolving from essential thrombocythemia in two patients treated with hydroxyurea.,"Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an uncommon myeloproliferative disorder, which is thought to develop from a multipotent stem cell. Like other myeloproliferative diseases, ET is associated with an increased risk of development of acute leukemia (AL). However, the large majority of cases of leukemic transformation in ET are thought to be related to prior therapy, usually radioactive phosphorous or alkylating chemotherapy, and the development of AL in ET is extremely rare in the untreated patient. In this report, two cases of ET which evolved into AL without prior exposure to radiation or alkylating agents, and which were treated with long-term hydroxyurea therapy, are described. The first case had cytogenetic changes in the bone marrow suggestive of therapy-associated leukemia, and the second developed myelodysplastic syndrome on therapy which was likely chemotherapy-induced and led to acute leukemia. Prolonged used of hydroxyurea in patients with ET may lead to therapy-associated acute leukemia.",1996,2
1458,8586895,Prolongation of the QT interval observed in a Japanese patient with vivax malaria following treatment with halofantrine.,"In 1992, some 90 countries or territories where 42% of the world's population resided were considered malarious and estimation of deaths from malaria worldwide per year were in the order of 1.4 of 2.8 million. The higher the number of Japanese who go abroad becomes (the total number in 1994 was 13,578,934: Records of Statistical Division of the Ministry of Justice), the greater is the risk of their contracting malaria. Indeed, the reported annual number of imported malaria cases increased to not less than 100. Now, malaria should first be presumed if a patient complains of a higher fever after a visit to a tropical country. And the importance of instituting prompt diagnosis and proper treatment should also be stressed. One of the antimalarials which has been highlighted for its effectiveness is halofantrine. This drug has been used for treatment of human malaria since 1984, and to date clinical trials have involved about 3.4 million patients in more than 30 countries (personal communication). Several patients successfully treated with halofantrine without any treatment failure have also been documented in Japan. However, in 1993, a clinical study involving 400 patients on the Thai-Burmese border revealed cardiac effects of antimalarial treatment with halofantrine, including one sudden death after the treatment. There have also been some spontaneous reports of serious ventricular dysrythmiasis with prolongation of the QT intervals, rarely associated with death. The pharmaceutical company producing Halfan has reported 8 cardiac arrests, leading to 6 deaths, when a higher dose than recommended was used, there was recent or concomitant treatment with mefloquine, there was pre-existing prolongation of the QT interval or the patient had a thiamine deficiency. Finally, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a ""drug alert"" on halofantrine advising a change in recommendations for its use. In the present paper, we discuss the first Japanese vivax malaria patient whose QT interval was prolonged after treatment with halofantrine.",1995,12

1460,8597009,Phenytoin toxicity due to concomitant antituberculosis therapy.,"Isoniazid inhibits the metabolism of phenytoin. Slow acetylators, who comprise roughly 50% of the South African population, are likely to develop clinical and biochemical features of phenytoin toxicity when this drug is given together with antituberculosis therapy. We describe a patient in whom this interaction caused a series of dangerous clinical events. Seventy-four per cent of patients with epileptogenic disorders seen at the Emergency Unit at Groote Schuur Hospital were on phenytoin and 11.6% of these had blood levels in the toxic range. The wide use of phenytoin during the recent tuberculosis epidemic makes it imperative to suspect this drug interaction in patients exhibiting clinical features that might be related to phenytoin toxicity. Knowledge of this interaction and adjustment of the dose of phenytoin should enable clinicians to avoid this adverse drug interaction.",1995,11
1461,8604715,Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular acidosis secondary to foscarnet therapy.,"Foscarnet is used as therapy of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in immunosuppressed subjects. We present a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection under treatment with foscarnet for CMV retinitis who complained of thirst and polyuria. Laboratory data showed hypernatremia with increased plasma osmolality and metabolic hyperchloremic acidosis. A water deprivation test demonstrated a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Other laboratory studies, including urine pH, anion gap, titratable acidity, and bicarbonate, showed a distal tubular acidification defect. All abnormalities were transient, with recovery a few days after foscarnet withdrawal. No cases of renal acidosis, and only one case of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, has been previously reported as a complication of foscarnet treatment. Our patient developed both nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular acidosis with a temporal pattern that demonstrated a link between foscarnet therapy and these abnormalities.",1996,3

The patient underwent ocular examination.
The patient retained excellent visual acuity and the choroidal hemorrhage resolved completely within two months.
The administration of tissue plasminogen activator was responsible for the large extent of hemorrhage and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic choroidal detachment.",1996,5
1463,8627446,Accelerated nodulosis during methotrexate therapy for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.,"We describe two patients with rheumatoid factor-positive, polyarticular-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in whom accelerated nodulosis developed during methotrexate therapy. Although they had only a few nodules at diagnosis, the nodules increased in number and size 3 to 4 months after the start of methotrexate therapy in both patients. The nodules regressed after withdrawal of methotrexate therapy in one patient and were arrested with the addition of hydroxychloroquine in the other. Physicians treating patients with methotrexate for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis must be aware of this extraarticular side effect.",1996,5
1464,8636829,Macrophage activation syndrome in systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis successfully treated with cyclosporine.,"A macrophage activation syndrome, possibly related to methotrexate toxicity, developed in a boy with systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Corticosteroid administration was ineffective, whereas a prompt response to cyclosporine was observed. Two months later, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia developed.",1996,2
1465,8638872,Jaundice induced by streptokinase.,"Streptokinase is the mainstream therapy for acute myocardial infarction. A fifty-seven-year-old man with acute MI was admitted to the intensive cardiac care unit and received streptokinase and heparin. At the time of admission, he was not receiving any drugs and denied any previous exposure to a hepatotoxic agent. Five hours later he developed a dramatic hypersensitivity reaction including high fever, pulmonary edema, cyanosis, and convulsions. Within twelve hours, his clinical state was stabilized. After forty-eight hours, he developed jaundice and transaminasemia, which subsided by the eighth day. Only a few reports of overt jaundice are associated with streptokinase.",1996,3
1466,8641617,Clostridium difficile colitis associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence and cause of Clostridium difficile colitis occurring after cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients. Thirty-three patients with primary ovarian malignancy were treated with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy ranging from 1 to 12 (mean 4.6) cycles. All patients who developed diarrhea after undergoing the cancer chemotherapy were examined to determine whether or not they were complicated by C difficile colitis. The diagnosis of C. difficile was confirmed by a stool-cytotoxin test and endoscopic examination. Severe C. difficile colitis occurred in 2 patients (6.1%) after receiving cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for ovarian malignancies. Although both patients recovered from the colitis after the administration of vancomycin, the first case demonstrated a relapse of the colitis after receiving a subsequent course of the same chemotherapy with cisplatin. Both patients were then treated with a carboplatin alternative to cisplatin in the following courses, which resulted in neither a relapse of the colitis nor a recurrence of the malignancies up to this time. This report suggests the importance of searching for the presence of C. difficile and its toxin in patients with diarrhea after undergoing cancer chemotherapy since C. difficile may cause severe colitis. Based on our findings, it is thus concluded that cisplatin may cause C. difficile colitis.",1996,6
1467,8645078,"Captopril-associated ""pseudocholangitis'. A case report and review of the literature.","Captopril, a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Captopril is known to be associated with dermatologic, hematologic, and pulmonary adverse effects. However, hepatotoxicity is extremely rare. A patient with severe cholestatic jaundice induced by captopril is presented. On admission to the hospital, the patient was diagnosed and treated as having cholangitis. Review of the literature showed similar occurrences in other patients. Patients treated with captopril who develop ""atypical cholangitis"" should be suspected of having captopril-associated liver damage.",1996,6
1468,8651254,Development of nephrotic syndrome in a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia after treatment with macrophage-colony-stimulating factor.,"We describe a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) who developed nephrotic syndrome after receiving several courses of chemotherapy, including macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). At the onset of nephrotic syndrome, the patient remained in a hematological remission. A renal biopsy showed diffuse mesangial proliferation with marked glomerular infiltration of macrophages and massive subendothelial and mesangial deposits. After the institution of the combined therapy with corticosteroid, anticoagulant, and dipyridamole, urinary protein excretion was attenuated to less than 1.0 g/day. It should be emphasized that the recurrence of nephrotic syndrome was observed after the following chemotherapy, including M-CSF, whereas the bone marrow still remained completely remitted. In contrast, after the last course of chemotherapy, which did not include M-CSF, urinary protein excretion was not enhanced. Of note is that the renal histology at autopsy showed a remarkable improvement of mesangial hypercellularity with concomitant reduction in the number of glomerular macrophages. These evolutional changes in both proteinuria and glomerular histology suggest a close linkage between the M-CSF treatment and macrophage-related glomerular injury. The possibility can be raised that M-CSF accelerated the underlying renal disease in this case through enhancing macrophage accumulation into the glomerulus, leading to the development of nephrotic syndrome.",1996,6
1469,8656412,Massive vulvar edema complicating tocolysis in a patient with twins. A case report.,"Severe vulvar edema is an extremely rare complication of pregnancy. One other case of tocolysis-induced vulvar edema has been reported, as have five cases of postpartum vulvar edema, associated with an 80% maternal mortality rate.
A multipara with a twin gestation presented with premature labor at 31 weeks. The patient had no history of trauma, lymphatic obstruction, venous obstruction or infection. On the fifth day of tocolysis with magnesium sulfate, nifedipine, terbutaline and betamethasone, edema developed in both labia. The following day the vulvar edema had increased and spread to the sacrum. The patient was normotensive and afebrile. Resolution occurred in spite of continuous tocolytic therapy, which was stopped at 35 weeks. Two days later, on hospital day 27, the patient spontaneously delivered two healthy, male infants.
The two reported cases of tocolysis-induced vulvar edema were not fatal and resolved after repositioning the patient in one case and by cesarean section in the other. However, since maternal death has occurred with postpartum vulvar edema, the patient with vulvar edema merits special attention. The WBC count should be determined and the patient's circulatory status evaluated to rule out hypovolemia.",1996,2
1470,8667442,"Milk-alkali syndrome induced by 1,25(OH)2D in a patient with hypoparathyroidism.","Milk-alkali syndrome was first described 70 years ago in the context of the treatment of peptic ulcer disease with large amounts of calcium and alkali. Although with current ulcer therapy (H-2 blockers, omeprazole, and sucralfate), the frequency of milk-alkali syndrome has decreased significantly, the classic triad of hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal impairment remains the hallmark of the syndrome. Milk-alkali syndrome can present serious and occasionally life-threatening illness unless diagnosed and treated appropriately. This article presents a patient with hypoparathyroidism who was treated with calcium carbonate and calcitriol resulting in two admissions to the hospital for milk-alkali syndrome. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous pamidronate on his first admission and with hydrocortisone on the second. This illustrates intravenous pamidronate as a valuable therapeutic tool when milk-alkali syndrome presents as hypercalcemic emergency.",1996,5
1471,8672829,Ifosfamide-induced nonconvulsive status epilepticus.,"To describe a patient with ifosfamide-induced nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
A 71-year-old woman with a history of malignant mixed mesodermal tumor involving the uterus, cervix, and vagina was admitted because of local recurrence. After receiving 3 doses of ifosfamide/mesna, she was found to be unresponsive. Physical examination and laboratory data revealed no significant changes. An electroencephalogram was consistent with the diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The patient's mental status returned to baseline after treatment with intravenous phenytoin and discontinuation of ifosfamide therapy.
Central nervous system (CNS) toxicity has been described with ifosfamide, with most cases reported in the pediatric population. Among CNS toxicities, generalized tonic-clonic seizures have been reported in both children and adults. This represents the first report of nonconvulsive status epilepticus induced by ifosfamide.
There was a temporal relationship between the onset of nonconvulsive status epilepticus and initiation of ifosfamide infusion. No other identifiable factor contributed to the unresponsiveness.",1995,12
1472,8678015,Albendazole-induced pseudomembranous colitis.,"We report a patient with AIDS and intestinal microsporidiosis. While undergoing treatment with albendazole, he developed worsening diarrhea with abdominal pain and fever. The diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis was made by flexible sigmoidoscopy and a positive stool specimen for Clostridium difficile toxin. The patient's symptoms resolved with oral vancomycin and his stool C. difficile toxin became negative. Albendazole is an antibiotic that is chemically related to metronidazole. Although a few case reports link metronidazole with the development of pseudomembranous colitis, albendazole has not been associated with the development of this condition. The spectrum of antimicrobial activity of albendazole and its efficacy in the treatment of intestinal microsporidiosis are reviewed. Pathogenic mechanisms for the development of pseudomembranous colitis and the epidemiology of this condition in patients with AIDS are discussed.",1996,7
1473,8684546,Sodium thiosulfate in the treatment of tumoral calcifications in a hemodialysis patient without hyperparathyroidism.,"Extraskeletal tumoral calcifications (TC) may occur in patients with end-stage renal disease. The TC usually develop in the presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism or a high calcium x phosphate product, while other factors have been also occasionally implicated in their development. At present, no uniformly accepted effective treatment has been described for this condition. We describe a 58-year-old female patient with end-stage renal disease who 7 years after the onset of dialysis presented with pain and movement restriction of various joints. A skeletal X-ray showed huge amounts of periarticular TC. The TC occurred in the absence of hyperparathyroidism or a high calcium x phosphate product as evidenced by hormonal and biochemical examination as well as by a bone biopsy specimen that revealed an adynamic bone disease with significant aluminum staining. Sodium thiosulfate, an inorganic salt that has been claimed to inhibit the formation and to favor the solubility and the mobilization of calcified masses, was administered to the patient, and after a long period of treatment considerable radiological regression of the TC with concurrent clinical recovery was noticed. Aluminum intoxication, along with other factors, was considered to be the cause of TC development. The use of sodium thiosulfate seemed to be a reasonable nonspecific therapeutic approach for the management of TC in this case.",1996,0
1474,868978,Oculomotor disturbances associated with 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy.,Two patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for disseminated adenocarcinoma of the colon developed cerebellar dysfunction typical of 5-FU neurotoxicity. The neurotoxicity was associated with oculomotor disturbances expressed primarily as weakness of convergence and divergence. Detailed postmortem examination of one patient revealed no anatomical abnormalities of the central nervous system. The ocular motor disturbances are probably an expression of regional 5-FU neurotoxicity primarily affecting the brain stem.,1977,6
1475,8691927,Growth and adrenal suppression in asthmatic children treated with high-dose fluticasone propionate.,"Fluticasone propionate was introduced in 1993 in the UK as a potentially safer inhaled corticosteroid than those already in use. The efficacy and safety of fluticasone has been established at recommended doses of 200 micrograms/day, but not at higher doses that are often used.
Growth retardation was observed in six severely asthmatic children after introduction of high-dose fluticasone propionate treatment (dry powder). Assessment of cortisol response was by insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in three cases, by short tetracosactrin test in two, and by low-dose tetracosactrin and 24-hour urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio in one.
Six children with growth retardation noted after treatment with high-dose fluticasone propionate were found to have adrenal suppression. In one case the growth rate and cortisol response returned to normal 9 months after the fluticasone dose was reduced to 500 micrograms/day.
When high doses of fluticasone propionate are used, growth may be retarded and adrenal suppression may occur.",1996,7

Several cases have been described in the United Kingdom and recently in the United States. In my opinion this reaction is not so uncommon as thought. Possible causes of this phenomenon are proposed keeping in mind that a hypotensive drug can cause intra ocular pressure rise. The incidence of similar cases seems to increase.,1995,0
1477,8700794,Intranasal desmopressin-induced hyponatremia.,"Desmopressin is a commonly used, well-tolerated agent for the treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis and central diabetes insipidus. Intranasal desmopressin provides symptomatic relief with few serious complications. A 29-year-old woman with a long history of primary nocturnal enuresis began treatment with intranasal desmopressin. Although the enuresis ceased, she developed throbbing headaches, nausea, vomiting, paresthesia, lethargy, fatigue, and altered mental status over the next 7 days. When she came to the emergency room her sodium concentration was 127 mmol/L. The history of desmopressin use was not obtained at that time. She was treated with intravenous fluids and discharged. The symptoms returned and worsened over the next 4 days, and she returned to the emergency room stuporous. A repeat sodium was 124 mmol/L, and she was admitted. The history of desmopressin use was still not available. Medical evaluations included computerized tomography, lumbar puncture, complete blood counts, serum chemistries, and serologies. The next morning the woman was improved and informed clinicians of her desmopressin use. Without other causes for the hyponatremia, she was diagnosed with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, presumably caused by desmopressin. Within 24 hours of fluid restriction and cessation of desmopressin, her symptoms and hyponatremia resolved. A review of the literature found 11 children and 2 adults in whom intranasal desmopressin was associated with hyponatremia, all of whom experienced seizures or altered mental status. Our patient illustrates the importance of early recognition and treatment of hyponatremia before the onset of seizures. When vague symptoms develop during desmopressin therapy, hyponatremia must be considered as part of the differential diagnosis. It may also be prudent to screen for electrolyte abnormalities in patients taking this agent to prevent serious iatrogenic complications.",0,0

The patients developed uveitis, sometimes in combination with a transient rash, arthralgia, arthritis, jaundice and pseudojaundice. It seems likely that these reactions were caused by rifabutin, alone or together with other drugs such as clarithromycin. These adverse reactions probably depend on the dose, metabolism and excretion of the drug. Inhibition of cytochrome P450 seems to be an important mechanism.",1996,6
1479,8726608,Does acyclovir increase serum lithium levels?,"A 42-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital to receive intravenous acyclovir for a herpes zoster infection. At the time she was taking lithium carbonate 450 mg twice/day. Six days after starting acyclovir she exhibited signs of lithium toxicity. When measured, the serum lithium level had increased 4-fold during acyclovir therapy. Both agents are excreted by the kidneys, raising the possibility that acyclovir at high serum concentrations may interfere with the renal excretion of lithium. A MEDLINE search did not identify any citation describing the possibility of an interaction between the drugs. This case suggests that acyclovir when given intravenously in doses of 10 mg/kg may result in increased serum lithium concentrations. Until additional data are available, if intravenous acyclovir is administered concurrently with lithium, we recommend closely monitoring patients for signs of lithium toxicity and measuring serum lithium levels every second or third day.",0,0

It is indicated in many inflammatory skin conditions characterized by polymorphonuclear cell infiltration. Minor reactions to the drug are very common, but severe idiosyncratic reactions are rare considering the large number of patients taking this drug worldwide. We describe 2 patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus who developed severe dapsone reaction after low dose therapy, with a fatal outcome in one. Physicians should be aware of the potentially lethal side effects of dapsone.",1996,4

1482,8739289,Transient central diabetes insipidus in the setting of underlying chronic nephrogenic diabetes insipidus associated with lithium use.,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a well-documented complication of lithium use. The association of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) with lithium use is rare. We report a patient receiving chronic lithium therapy who presented with a transient CDI occurring in the setting of underlying chronic NDI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of lithium-associated CDI and NDI presenting concurrently. Potential mechanisms regarding the pathophysiology of lithium-associated CDI are discussed. This case emphasizes the importance of the evaluation of lithium-associated polyuria with a direct measurement of plasma vasopressin, interpreted with simultaneous plasma and urine osmolality to secure the correct diagnosis and ensure appropriate therapeutic management.",1996,0
1483,8742573,Human insulin-induced lipoatrophy. Successful treatment using a jet-injection device.,"To evaluate the efficacy of the administration of insulin by a jet-injector device in stopping and reversing severe human insulin-induced lipoatrophy.
We report a case of a woman with severe human insulin-induced lipoatrophy who has been treated exclusively with recombinant DNA human insulin since the onset of IDDM.
The loss of subcutaneous tissue in the injection areas was demonstrated and measured by high-frequency ultrasound. Dermatologic exam demonstrated a severe reduction of fat tissue. After 8 months of administration of human insulin by a jet injector, there were no more new lesions of lipoatrophy and those affected areas were substantially ameliorated.
Jet-injection devices might constitute a helpful method to treat those patients affected by severe human insulin-induced lipoatrophy.",1996,3
1484,8749646,Seizures associated with ofloxacin therapy.,We describe four patients who had seizures while receiving ofloxacin; no other causes were evident. Common factors among all patients included advanced age and use of a high-dose regimen. The renal insufficiency of three patients and the timing of the seizures implicate accumulation of ofloxacin as a contributing factor. Other potentially related factors included electrolyte abnormalities and prior neurological insult. Improved awareness of and further investigation into the neurotoxic effects of ofloxacin may enhance its safe use.,1995,12

1487,8771575,Nitrofurantoin-induced pulmonary toxicity during pregnancy: a report of a case and review of the literature.,"Acute pulmonary reactions to nitrofurantoin are an uncommon side effect of therapy and can cause minor or life-threatening pulmonary dysfunction. Symptoms include fever, chills, cough, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea. Rarely, pleural effusion and/or pulmonary hemorrhage may occur. Diagnosis is made by clinical suspicion and exclusion of other causes of respiratory compromise. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be used to rule out infectious etiologies, and an increase in BAL fluid eosinophils is suggestive of drug-induced toxicity. The acute reaction to nitrofurantoin is believed to be mediated by an immune mechanism. Treatment is mainly discontinuation of the drug, however, corticosteroid therapy is recommended for severe reactions. A chronic reaction associated with long-term treatment with nitrofurantoin has also been reported and causes irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. Nitrofurantoin is commonly used to treat urinary tract infections during pregnancy. Despite the known pulmonary side effects of nitrofurantoin, there is no report of this toxicity occurring in pregnant patients. We present a case of respiratory failure occurring in a woman at 16 weeks' gestation who was being treated with nitrofurantoin for a urinary tract infection.",1996,6
1488,8792511,Dapsone in rheumatoid arthritis.,"Dapsone, a synthetic sulfone with chemical similarities to sulfapyridine, has been used for a number of years to treat leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis. Recently, a number of prospective, randomized, double-blind trials have shown their success in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, with dapsone being superior to placebo and comparable to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Its mode of anti-inflammatory actions in rheumatoid arthritis is not clearly understood, but modulation of neutrophil activity or inhibition of neutrophil inflammatory product formation or release appear to play a role. The major limiting side effect is hemolytic anemia, which may be mitigated through careful patient selection, conservative drug dosing, close monitoring, and possibly, concurrent administration of antioxidants or cytochrome P450 inhibitors. Methemoglobinemia is another common finding among patients receiving dapsone therapy, but rarely does it result in prominent symptoms other than transient pallor. Less common adverse events to dapsone include the idiosyncratic reactions of leukopenia and agranulocytosis, cutaneous eruptions, peripheral neuropathy, psychosis, toxic hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, nephrotic syndrome, renal papillary necrosis, severe hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome, and minor neurological and gastrointestinal complaints. In this report, two patients with advanced rheumatoid arthritis, who were safely and effectively treated with dapsone after failure with other second-line agents, are described and the literature is reviewed. We suggest that dapsone is an effective second-line agent in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",1996,6
1489,879939,Acetazolamide-accelerated anticonvulsant osteomalacia.,"Severe osteomalacia was present in two epileptic patients who were under long-term treatment with congeners of phenytoin, phenobarbital, and acetazolamide. These patients showed slightly low serum calcium, normal or low serum phosphate, and normal parathyroid hormone concentrations. Discontinuation of acetazolamide produced an immediate threefold drop in the level of urinary calcium excretion and a slight rise in tubular reabsorption of phosphate, with no dectectable change in serum calcium or phosphate concentrations. Acetazolamide may have accelerated the development of osteomalacia by several mechanisms, including increased renal calcium excretion.",1977,8
1490,8816294,Reversal of CNS-prophylaxis-related leukoencephalopathy after CSF shunting: case histories of identical twins.,"We report the case histories of identical twin brothers who developed concordant acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 4 years and who later developed leukoencephalopathy and hydrocephalus related to central nervous system prophylaxis by, in the first case intrathecally administered methotrexate and, in the second by intrathecally administered methotrexate and cranial irradiation. The delayed encephalopathy developed 9 and 22 months respectively after the first dose of intrathecal methotrexate. Both patients underwent cerebrospinal fluid shunting mainly for their hydrocephalus. The imaging studies have shown that both hydrocephalus and leukoencephalopathy have improved significantly after ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion. We review the pathophysiology of prophylaxis-related encephalopathy in leukemia patients and summarize its clinical, histological, and radiological characteristics. We also discuss the possible contribution of altered cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in the development of leukoencephalopathy.",1996,6

Several cases of lithium-induced Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome have been reported to date; all of them were elderly patients and a half had ""therapeutic"" lithium serum levels. Patients in this age group receiving antimanic maintenance treatment should keep lithium serum levels as low as possible. Lithium neurotoxicity should be considered in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease differential diagnosis, serial electroencephalograms being the most valuable.",1996,8
1493,8832451,A noninvasive method in the differential diagnosis of vecuronium-induced and magnesium-induced protracted neuromuscular block in a severely preeclamptic patient.,"The occurrence of neuromuscular blockade and the resulting potentiation of muscle relaxants during magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) administration is well known. However, a method to differentiate the neuromuscular block induced by magnesium from that induced by curariform nondepolarizing muscle relaxant in the clinical setting has never been reported. We report a case in which the duration of action of 1 mg of vecuronium lasted 4 hours in a patient with severe preeclampsia whose serum magnesium level was in the therapeutic range. We believe this is a remarkable potentiation on record in the literature. We also describe a new, noninvasive method to assess magnesium-induced neuromuscular block when curariform muscle relaxant was given simultaneously.",1996,8
1494,8835752,Terbinafine-induced cholestatic liver disease.,"Hepatobiliary disorders associated with orally administered terbinafine have rarely been reported. We describe a case of prolonged terbinafine-induced cholestatic liver disease. Extrahepatic cholestasis, viral hepatitis and autoimmune liver disorders were excluded. The histological findings of marked cholestasis without evidence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction or acute hepatitis were compatible with the diagnosis of drug-induced liver disease. Biochemical parameters of liver cell damage returned to normal levels 6 months later.",1996,6
1495,8840640,Metabolic acidosis induced by cetrimide-chlorhexidine solution in hydatid cyst surgery.,A patient with a large hydatid cyst of the left lobe of the liver developed metabolic acidosis following rather liberal use of cetrimide-chlorhexidine solution as a scolicidal agent. The progress and management of this complication are described in the patient is being reported.,1996,7
1496,8844232,An unusual case of Ecstasy poisoning.,"We describe a case of poisoning with 3,4-methylenedioxymet-amphetamine Ecstasy that presented with all the features suggestive of a fatal outcome, including a creatinine phosphokinase level markedly higher than any previously reported. The patient, a paraplegic, was treated with dantrolene and made a full recovery.",1996,7
1497,8850251,Two cases of mequitazine-induced photosensitivity reactions.,"Mequitazine is a phenothiazine derivative antihistamine. We experienced 2 cases of mequitazine-induced photosensitivity reaction in patients who took mequitazine for their dermatologic problems. Case no. 1 showed features of photoallergy such as 1-month incubation period, decreased MED to UVA, strong positive photopatch test result, cross reaction to chlorpromazine, and angry back phenomenon found in allergic contact dermatitis. In addition, an immediate erythematous macule was observed on the photopatch test site of mequitazine directly after UV exposure which was similar to the immediate erythema noted in chlorpromazine photoallergy. During the follow-up period of two months, there was transiently decreased MED to UVB, which became normalized after 1 month treatment with cyclophosphamide. In case no. 2, the pathogenic mechanism seemed to be persistent light reaction preceded by systemic photoallergy, as he had taken mequitazine for 6 months, and there were strong positive photopatch test results with immediate erythema reaction, cross-reaction to promethazine, decreased MED to both UVA and UVB, and persistence of the photosensitivity over a 3-year follow-up period after discontinuation of the mequitazine. Photopatch tests to 1% mequitazine with 5 J/cm2 of UVA in 30 normal subjects were all negative, which means that 1% concentration may be appropriate for the photopatch test. Mequitazine seemed to play a part similar to chlorpromazine, and absence of mequitazine-induced photosensitivity may be due to a relatively low dosage of the drug. However, dermatologists should be cautious about a photosensitivity reaction induced by mequitazine or other phenothiazine-derivative drugs.",1995,8
1498,8862924,Keratitis in methamphetamine abusers.,"We report four cases of severe corneal ulceration in methamphetamine abusers. Methamphetamine abuse has been increasing in California and may exceed cocaine abuse in some regions. Methamphetamine's extensive physiologic effects, inconsistent street purity, and multiple routes of administration offer many possibilities for injury to the cornea. Potential causes of methamphetamine-related keratitis can be divided into four categories resulting from (a) direct pharmacologic and physical effects of methamphetamine; (b) the toxic effects of diluting or ""cutting"" agents such as lidocaine and quinine; (c) effects related to the route of drug administration (intravenous, inhalation, smoking); and (d) manufacture-related effects of exposure to unintentional caustic contaminants in the final product. The increasing prevalence of methamphetamine abuse and the severity of the associated ulcers should alert ophthalmologists to the problem of methamphetamine-related keratitis.",1996,9
1499,8864370,"Methotrexate-induced liver cirrhosis. Clinical, histological and serological studies--a further 10-year follow-up.","Methotrexate (MTX) may induce liver damage, which in some psoriatics will lead to fibrosis or cirrhosis. Studies performed 10 years ago on 25 patients with MTX-induced liver cirrhosis indicated that this type of cirrhosis was not of an aggressive nature.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the present status of surviving patients 10 years later, together with the latest clinical and histological data on patients who had died.
The investigations were carried out on 186 liver biopsies and 5 autopsies. All biopsies were studied by the same pathologist. Eleven surviving patients were also studied by analysis of serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), which is an indicator of fibrogenesis, which is especially suitable for follow-up of fibrotic liver disease.
Thirteen patients had died; 1 of these died of liver failure. Another patient died form an overdose due to misunderstanding of the prescribed dosage given elsewhere. The remaining deaths were non-MTX related, but all 5 autopsies showed some degree of cirrhosis. On the other hand, 13 patients had no histologically verified liver cirrhosis in their latest biopsy, and PIIINP was within the normal range in all 11 patients investigated, this in spite of total cumulative MTX doses from 1,120 to 18,645 mg (mean 7,171 mg).
This study confirmed that in most patients MTX-induced liver cirrhosis is not aggressive. However, continued low-dose MTX led, in spite of normal liver tests, 8 years after the last biopsy to liver failure and death in 1 of our patients. Our data support the continued use of liver biopsies in the surveillance of MTX-treated psoriatics.",1996,0
1500,8880251,Fulminant malignant hyperthermia associated with ketoacidotic diabetic coma.,"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) in humans is usually triggered by volatile anaesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants. However, other factors or drugs (e.g. cresol) are thought to induce MH. We report a case of fulminant MH associated with a ketoacidotic diabetic coma. After therapy for diabetic coma with insulin (containing the preservative cresol) and electrolyte solutions was started, the patient complained of increasing myalgia, developed a high fever and respiratory and metabolic acidosis and lost consciousness. MH was treated immediately with dantrolene; the patient recovered within 14 days. Five months later the patient was diagnosed as MH-susceptible by the in vitro caffeine and halothane contracture test. This case supports the assessment that MH and diabetes are associated diseases and that cresol could possibly trigger MH. Furthermore, therapy with dantrolene has been demonstrated to be beneficial in the treatment of MH associated with diabetic coma.",1996,8
1501,889156,The use of beclomethasone diproprionate inhaler complicated by the development of an eosinophilic pneumonia reaction.,"As an insoluble steroid aerosol, beclomethasone diproprionate was recently made available in the United States. Only minor complications have been reported previously. A more serious development of adrenal insufficiency may occur upon the improper replacement of systemic steroids. We report on a patient who developed the clinical findings of pulmonary eosinophilia. The possible mechanisms for this complication in out patient are discussed. While a lower systemic steroid dosage may have been the provoking factor, we feel that an adverse reaction to oleic acid, a dispersing agent in the aerosol freon vehicle, is a strong possibility.",1977,8
1502,8891729,Fatal intravascular autoimmune hemolytic anemia after fludarabine treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"We report the case of a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who developed fatal intravascular autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) after fludarabine treatment. He had previously received several treatments including two courses of fludarabine. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was negative at diagnosis but was found to be positive with anti-IgG after the first fludarabine treatment. When the patient was treated again with fludarabine nine months later, the DAT became positive with anti-IgG and anti-C3d antiglobulins after the second course of treatment. Abrupt, fatal intravascular hemolysis occurred after the third course. The occurrence of severe AIHA in CLL patients treated with fludarabine has been reported by several authors. Physicians should be aware of the risk of severe AIHA in CLL patients with a history of AIHA or positivation of the DAT during previous fludarabine administration, or in case of secondary fixation of complement to the red cell membrane occurring during fludarabine treatment.",1996,8
1503,8903300,Tetany in a child with AIDS receiving intravenous tobramycin.,"Aminoglycosides have been reported to cause tetany by inducing renal wasting of magnesium and secondary hypocalcemia. A 9-year-old girl with AIDS was brought to the emergency department because of tetany. She had just finished a 3-week course of intravenous tobramycin for bronchiectasis and had an elevated serum tobramycin trough level 1 week before the onset of tetany. Hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia had developed. The urine revealed inappropriately high levels of magnesium and potassium despite critically low serum levels, with an appropriately low urine calcium level. This pattern is suggestive of renal toxicity due to tobramycin. Over the next several months, she continued to require supplemental calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus. She also had nephrotic range proteinuria. Aminoglycoside renal mineral wasting has not previously been described in a child.",1996,11
1504,8908396,Insulin-induced lipoatrophy in type I diabetes. A possible tumor necrosis factor-alpha-mediated dedifferentiation of adipocytes.,"To test the hypothesis that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha may mediate the loss and the dedifferentiation of subcutaneous fat tissue in the insulin-induced lipoatrophies of a diabetic patient who presented extensive lesions.
An in vitro exploration of cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the reported case was performed and compared with the same explorations of PBMC from three nondiabetic subjects and three diabetic patients without lipoatrophic lesions. A proliferation test and an evaluation of TNF-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 production from PBMC in presence of insulin were studied.
The production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by the macrophages of the patient in presence of insulin were dramatically increased in comparison with control subjects. This process needed cooperation with other lymphoid cells and was abrogated by dexamethasone.
In our reported case, a local hyperproduction of TNF-alpha from macrophages that was induced by the injected insulin could explain the dedifferentiation of the adipocytes of the subcutaneous tissue and the reversion that was induced by the local injection of dexamethasone.",1996,11
1505,8912599,Erosion of psoriatic plaques: an early sign of methotrexate toxicity.,"Methotrexate is an effective but potentially toxic treatment for psoriasis. Well-known signs of methotrexate toxicity include bone marrow suppression and oral and gastrointestinal ulceration. Painful erosion of psoriatic plaques is a less common sign of methotrexate toxicity that may precede evidence of bone marrow suppression. We describe two patients in whom painful erosions of their psoriasis developed as the presenting sign of methotrexate toxicity and review the literature, emphasizing the risk factors associated with this manifestation.",1996,11
1506,8921647,Caution with use of cimetidine in tolazoline induced upper gastrointestinal bleeding.,"A 2-day-old newborn was treated with tolazoline for persistent pulmonary hypertension due to meconium aspiration syndrome. Hypoxemia improved during continuous tolazoline infusion, but gastrointestinal bleeding occurred. After treatment with cimetidine, there was a rapid deterioration with decreased oxygen saturation and arterial PO2 values. Tolazoline induces a dilatation of the pulmonary vascular system by stimulating H2 receptors. Cimetidine, an H2 blocker, may partially abolish the effect of tolazoline. However, given the clinically significant result to the interaction between tolazoline and cimetidine we report, the use of cimetidine in tolazoline induced upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage should deserve more attention.",1996,9
1507,8926752,Zolpidem tissue concentrations in a multiple drug related death involving Ambien.,"Zolpidem (Ambien), a relatively new nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic, was involved in the death of a 39-year-old obese male who was being treated for depression and insomnia. The identification and quantitation procedures of zolpidem in postmortem tissues included dual-column gas chromatography (GC) with nitrogen-phosphorus detection and GC-mass spectrometry. Zolpidem was present at concentrations of 2.91, 1.40, and 2.13 microg/mL in the heart blood, peripheral blood, and urine, respectively. The liver had zolpidem present at a concentration of 4.74 microg/g, and the gastric contents had a total of 172 mg zolpidem. Additional drugs present included hydrocodone and morphine (nonconjugated) at 0.16 and 0.04 microg/mL, respectively. The cause of death was determined to be multiple drug intoxication. This report describes the analytical techniques and significance of the zolpidem findings.",1995,10
1508,8933322,Methemoglobinemia secondary to cleaning solution ingestion.,"Methemoglobinemia is a rare cause of cyanosis in pediatric patients. A 16-month-old male presented to the Emergency Department cyanotic and short of breath after ingestion of a hair-care-equipment cleaning solution. After calling the salon and consulting Poisindex, the substance was found to be Mar-V-cide, containing 20% Hyamine 3500, 50% cationic detergents, 20% isopropyl alcohol, and 1% sodium nitrite, which caused the methemoglobinemia in this case. Initial pulse oximetry on room air was 72% and improved minimally with supplemented oxygen. The patient's methemoglobin level was 63%. Methylene blue was administered (2 mg/kg intravenously), and the patient rapidly improved. Nitrates occur in high concentrations in some food and water. Infants are particularly susceptible to chronic nitrate-induced methemoglobinemia because of their low stomach acid production, large numbers of nitrite-reducing bacteria, and the relatively easy oxidation of fetal hemoglobin. Acute nitrite toxicity results from industrial exposure, accidental ingestion (e.g., abuse of organic nitrites as an aphrodisiac, especially in the male homosexual population), and suicidal ingestion. Methemoglobinemia may occur in a number of drug or chemical ingestions, but a comprehensive review of the literature failed to identify a similar reported case.",0,0
1509,8936932,Cardiac arrest after esmolol administration: a review of acute beta-blocker toxicity.,"An 11-year-old, 25-kg girl with congenital myelomeningocele was scheduled for posterior spinal fusion because of progressive scoliosis. After induction of general anesthesia and administration of a standard dose of intravenous esmolol hydrochloride, her cardiac rhythm progressed to asystole. Although given ephedrine, epinephrine, and atropine sulfate, the patient's normal heart rhythm could not be restored until calcium chloride was administered. A review of the medical literature indicates that the optimal treatment for acute beta-blocker toxicity is intravenous glucagon. Calcium administration should also be considered. Acute esmolol toxicity may be self-limiting because of its extremely short half-life.",1996,10
1510,8942269,Atenolol induced memory impairment: a case report.,This report deals with a 54-year-old man with loss of memory. His impaired memory was found to be due to the atenolol he was on and he made a complete recovery on withdrawing the beta-blocker. This patient's experience stresses the need to consider beta-blockers as a potentially reversible cause of memory impairment.,1996,4
1511,8949576,"Failure of plasmapheresis, corticosteroids and thionamides to ameliorate a case of protracted amiodarone-induced thyroiditis.","We report a case of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis of protracted duration, unresponsive to conventional thionamide therapy, with therapy limited by severe adverse drug reactions. Other treatment modalities included high dose corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, lithium and perchlorate. Temporary amelioration was achieved following plasmapheresis; however, this and other measures were unsuccessful in controlling the thyrotoxicosis, which deteriorated to thyroid storm. Histopathologically, a degenerative, inflammatory thyroiditis was evident. We discuss the limitations of conventional drug therapy and the lack of a sustained response to plasmapheresis. The failure of high doses steroids to alter the course of illness and to completely suppress the thyroidal inflammatory process is highlighted. A potential role for renal and hepatic impairment in the observed protracted course of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is suggested.",1996,9
1512,8961730,Psychotic disorder associated with isoniazid.,We evaluated a patient who developed a psychotic disorder after 4 months of isoniazid prophylaxis for a positive tuberculosis tine test. His symptoms resolved within 2 weeks of discontinuing the isoniazid. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of psychotic symptoms with the use of this agent.,1996,11
1513,8969033,Ketanserin in the treatment of protamine-induced pulmonary hypertension.,"The reversal of heparin by protamine may cause severe hemodynamic deterioration, characterized by systemic hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, and bronchoconstriction. A case report is presented concerning the administration of ketanserin in the treatment of pulmonary vasoconstriction and right ventricular failure following the infusion of protamine in a patient undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery and mitral valve replacement. The potential role of serotonin in the development of this serious complication is discussed.",1996,0
1514,897744,"Focal glomerulonephritis and interstitial nephritis in methicillin-treated, heroin-related infective endocarditis.","A drug addict with staphylococcal endocarditis treated with methicillin, who developed massive proteinuria and acute nephritic syndrome is described. Discontinuation of methicillin therapy and appropriate antibiotic treatment of endocarditis led to clinical improvement, emphasizing the need to promptly discontinue potential nephrotoxic agents when abnormalities in renal function appear. The clinical course and results of renal biopsy studies suggest multiple causes of the renal lesions in this patient.",1977,9
1515,8979664,Uveitis associated with rifabutin therapy: a clinical alert.,"The incidence of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is increasing among patients with AIDS. Rifabutin therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment and prophylaxis of MAC infection. over the past 3 years there have been several reports of uveitis associated with rifabutin therapy. The uveitis is almost always interior, begins unilaterally and progresses to involve both eyes. There is almost always a hypopyon present, and the uveitis progresses aggressively. It responds well to conventional treatment along with the discontinuance of rifabutin.
This paper presents a new case of rifabutin uveitis and a review of the various published reports to date.
All primary eye care clinicians should be aware of this new and unique clinical presentation and be prepared to recognize it quickly and treat it appropriately.",1996,11
1516,8996514,Large cerebral infarction during praziquantel therapy in neurocysticercosis.,"Large cerebral infarction is a rare complication of neurocysticercosis. Endarteritis by inflammation of the leptomeninges is known to be its cause.
A 59-year-old man with known neurocysticercosis developed a large cerebral infarction during praziquantel therapy. A follow-up MRI obtained immediately after his cerebral infarction demonstrated notable decrease in the size of the cysts and more prominent enhancement around the peripheral margins of the cysts and the major vessels in comparison with the initial MRI. Cerebral angiography disclosed occlusions and narrowing of both internal carotid arteries at the supraclinoid portions, where multiple cysts were found on the MRI.
Findings in our patient strongly suggest that a secondary inflammation reaction caused by the destruction of the cysts might have enhanced the process of endarteritis. The possible deleterious effects of praziquantel therapy should be considered in the treatment of patients with subarachnoid cysticerci.",1997,1
1517,9007910,Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency: a pharmacogenetic defect causing severe adverse reactions to 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy.,"To describe the pharmacogenetic syndrome of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, which predisposes patients with cancer to potentially lethal adverse reactions following 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy.
Published articles, abstracts, and conference proceedings.
Genetic deficiencies in DPD, the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for 5-FU catabolism, may occur in 3% or more of patients with cancer putting them at increased risk for unusually severe adverse reactions (e.g., diarrhea, stomatitis, mucositis, myelosuppression, neurotoxicity) to standard doses of 5-FU. Diagnosis of DPD deficiency must be confirmed by specialized laboratory tests. The principle treatment for DPD-deficient patients with severe acute 5-FU reactions is supportive care; however, the administration of thymidine potentially may reverse severe 5-FU-induced neurologic symptoms such as encephalopathy and coma.
Early recognition of this serious pharmacogenetic syndrome may allow for the modification of future chemotherapy, thus avoiding further life-threatening toxicities.
Nurses must understand the pharmacology, mechanism of action, clinical presentation, potentially lethal risks, and traumatic psychosocial stresses experienced by DPD-deficient patients with cancer receiving 5-FU therapy in order to develop timely interventions and alternative plans of care.",0,0

A case report and review of the literature.,"A 49-year-old man with Crohn's disease treated with prednisone and mesalamine (5-ASA) developed worsening respiratory distress and fever. Symptoms improved after discontinuation of mesalamine. A rechallenge 3 months later caused similar pulmonary symptoms, confirming the association between the drug and the respiratory system. Mesalamine may cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis in patients with Crohn's disease.",1997,1
1519,9017913,A case report of Cheyletiella infestation on a Whippet dog in Korea.,"A clinical case of Cheyletiella infestation on a dog born and raised in Korea is reported. A three-year old female Whippet was hospitalized due to a multiple fracture and displacement of the left scapula caused by a recent car accident. The mite infestation was not noticed at the time of hospitalization. The dog underwent multiple operations involving internal fixation of the fractured scapula with wire and a plate, followed by extensive chemotherapy with antibiotics and prednisolone. After two months of hospitalization, a pruritic dermatitis near the left scapula developed. Multiple white dandruff-like flakes were seen on the hair coat, especially over the dorsal spine and neck, and the dog expressed increased pruritus by frequently licking and scratching the affected areas. Local dense accumulations of skin debris that became crusty were also observed. Microscopic examination of a skin scraping revealed a heavy infestation of cheyletiella yasguri, as identified by the presence of hoks of the palpi and the heart-shaped sensory organ on genu I. Immunosuppression elicited by the extensive administration of prednisolone was suspected for the initiation of the generalized mite infestation.",1996,12
1520,9022114,Delay of corneal wound healing in patients treated with colchicine.,"Colchicine has a known adverse effect on wound healing through its inhibitory effect on tubulin-dependent cell functions and through collagenase activation. In the cornea, it has been shown in animal and in vitro studies to inhibit epithelium mitosis, fibroblast mitosis and migration, as well as to reduce collagen deposition. The authors report on two patients with corneal ulcers refractory to conventional treatment while the patients were undergoing oral colchicine therapy.
The first patient was an 86-year-old woman who had been treated with oral colchicine because of rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the authors' department with a deep corneal ulcer in the right eye for which she had been treated for 3 weeks with local antibiotics without any improvement. The second patient, a 60-year-old woman, was hospitalized because of a corneal ulcer in her left eye. She had been receiving oral colchicine therapy for mixed connective tissue disease. Treatment with local antibiotics was initiated but the condition of the eye worsened, ultimately resulting in corneal perforation.
Withdrawal of oral colchicine therapy was followed by rapid corneal wound healing in both patients.
The findings in these two patients suggest that colchicine may delay corneal wound healing. The authors suggest that in patients with corneal ulcers refractory to conventional treatment who are receiving colchicine, cessation of colchicine therapy should be considered.",1997,1

1522,9039216,"Fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, lymphocytosis, hepatitis, and dermatitis: a severe adverse reaction to minocycline.","A 17-year-old female patient who had been taking oral minocycline (50 mg twice daily) for 3 weeks for acne developed an eruption that progressed to an exfoliative dermatitis. This illness was also characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, a leukemoid reaction, lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, hepatitis, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Dramatic improvement followed institution of corticosteroid therapy. Studies for infectious and collagen vascular diseases were negative. This severe illness was likely caused by minocycline, and we speculate that minocycline may have acted as a superantigen, causing lymphocyte over-activation and massive cytokine release.",1997,2
1523,9042097,Delayed hypersensitivity to flurbiprofen.,"Immune-mediated reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are unusual, and true allergy to the drug flurbiprofen has never been documented. We observed a patient who developed a maculopapular rash 48 h after beginning oral therapy with this drug, and 2 days later, angioedema and hypotension. Patch tests with flurbiprofen were positive 48 and 72 h after application. The clinical and allergologic features of this case strongly suggest type IV hypersensitivity. Patch testing with NSAIDs is useful for confirming clinical diagnoses of delayed hypersensitivity to these drugs.",1997,1
1524,9052919,Eye movement disorders in bone marrow transplant patients on cyclosporin and ganciclovir.,"After 582 allogeneic bone marrow transplants, we have encountered four patients (0.7%) who developed transient unilateral or bilateral sixth nerve palsies. Three of the four patients also had bilateral ptosis. These signs resolved 24-48 h after cyclosporin and ganciclovir were discontinued. One patient had MRI T2 abnormalities compatible with cyclosporin neurotoxicity. We postulate that cyclosporin, possibly together with ganciclovir, can produce transient brain stem or neuromuscular dysfunction with eye movement abnormality in occasional patients.",1997,3
1525,9058350,"Thrombosis, leiomyoma and GnRH-a therapy. A case report.","Diverse complications have been reported in association with the growth and medical treatment of uterine leiomyomata. Infarction and necrosis may be common and incite complications from parasitic vascular attachment, pain and thrombosis. The rarity of severe complications in this situation warrants presentation of the following unique association.
A 33-year-old female, gravida 1, para 1, was treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) for three months prior to laparotomy and removal of a solitary, 5,190-g, pedunculated myoma. The mass had secured an additional vascular supply from the transverse colon and omentum. Although the immediate postoperative course was uncomplicated, delayed onset of abdominal pain and fever lead to the diagnosis of superior mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis. Portal vein thrombosis responded to thrombolytic infusion into the superior mesenteric artery. Superior mesenteric vein thrombosis persisted, with evidence of early vascular recanalization. After six weeks of additional anticoagulation, assessment by computed tomographic scan showed complete resolution of all thrombi.
While thrombosis has been reported with GnRH-a therapy in men with prostate cancer, its association with treatment in this benign case may have been a consequence of the massive tumor size. Steroid hormone deprivation potentially contributed to neovascularization and bowel involvement.",1997,2
1526,9094821,Adenomyosis in the broad ligament and tamoxifen: report of a case.,"Adenomyosis confined to the broad ligament is extremely rare. Herein we present a case of adenomyosis in the broad ligament with unusual gross features. This 41-year-old woman had been on tamoxifen therapy for 3 years due to breast cancer. Ten months after discontinuing tamoxifen, she underwent exploratory laparotomy for a right adnexal mass suspected as ovarian malignancy. At laparotomy, the mass was located in the right broad ligament with a fibrous stalk connecting to the uterus. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed adenomyosis with cyst formation and an unusual thick capsule. The possible effects of tamoxifen upon the uterus are discussed in this article, in view of reports of tamoxifen associated with endometrial carcinoma and endometriosis.",1997,2

A  number of similarities, including the fact that both medications are 250-mg white tablets, with similar generic and brand names which are generically repackaged medications juxtaposed on the pharmacist's shelf, predispose to the inadvertent substitution of one medication for the other. In one instance a systemic hypoglycemic reaction resulting in head trauma and confusion ended in an emegency hospital admission following the substitution of acetohexamide for acetazolamide.",1977,10

Its overall toxicity is considerably less compared to standard induction chemotherapy; however, it is associated with a high incidence of a potentially fatal symptom complex referred to as ""retinoic acid syndrome."" This report describes a patient with APL who developed the syndrome a few weeks after initiating induction therapy with ATRA despite being treated for hyperleukocytosis. The case illustrates the classic features of the syndrome and its dramatic response to corticosteroid treatment.",1997,4
1531,9149614,Nonsustained polymorphous ventricular tachycardia during amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation complicating cardiomyopathy. Management with intravenous magnesium sulfate.,"A case is presented in which amiodarone was administered to suppress paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in a patient with an idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Eleven days after initiation of therapy with amiodarone, the patient experienced syncope and was noted to have recurrent episodes of polymorphous ventricular tachycardia. The patient was hospitalized and treated with a bolus as well as continuous infusion of intravenous magnesium sulfate. When the infusion was transiently discontinued, recurrences of polymorphous ventricular tachycardia were noted. The probable proarrhythmic action of amiodarone, although rare, is reviewed along with a discussion of the novel use of intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy.",1997,5
1532,9161656,Acute asthma associated with sustained-release verapamil.,"To describe a patient with asymptomatic bronchial asthma and hypertension who developed an acute asthma attack after receiving sustained-release verapamil.
A 66-year-old white woman with a 10-year history of hypertension and bronchial asthma was switched from immediate-release verapamil hydrocloride 40 mg tid to sustained-release verapamil 240 mg/d po for better hypertension control. After taking the first tablet, she developed dyspnea, cough, and wheezing. Antiasthmatic medications were prescribed, but the asthma symptoms did not improve. She continued taking verapamil for 6 months, then, on her own, stopped all medications including the sustained-release verapamil, and her asthma symptoms disappeared. On rechallenge she developed severe dyspnea, cough, and wheezing 20 minutes after administration. The asthma resolved within 24 hours following three albuterol inhalations. The next day similar symptoms developed with rechallenge of the same brand of sustained-release verapamil in a 120-mg formulation, and verapamil was discontinued. Six months later she was again prescribed sustained-release verapamil 240 mg in another clinic where the physician was unaware of her previous reaction. Once again, severe dyspnea, cough, and wheezing developed.
On four separate occasions the patient was challenged advertently or inadvertently, with sustained-release verapamil. Similar symptoms developed after each challenge and resolved after discontinuing this preparation. Although dyspnea associated with verapamil administration has been reported, this is the first report of an elderly asymptomatic asthmatic patient with hypertension who developed an acute asthma attack following sustained-release verapamil administration.
Sustained-release verapamil is thought to be the cause of the asthma attack in this patient because she was not taking any other preparations; the symptoms started with the administration of sustained-release verapamil and were relieved after its discontinuation.",1997,5
1533,9169264,Cephalexin rash in infectious mononucleosis.,"The ampicillin rash occurring in cases of infectious mononucleosis is well documented. Similar phenomena have also been observed with other antibiotics. The case of a patient with infectious mononucleosis treated with cephalexin who later showed a rash is presented and the previous literature is reviewed. The rash seen in this patient, who was treated with cephalexin, may be similar to the rash seen with ampicillin treatment of patients with infectious mononucleosis. The mechanism by which these eruptions occur is not completely understood, although there are many interesting theories. Perhaps rashes during infectious mononucleosis in association with other antibiotics are actually more common, but just not recognized. A heightened awareness of this possibility may therefore lead to recognition of more cases and further understanding of this entity.",1997,5
1534,9177620,A possible case of carbamazepine induced pancreatitis.,"The authors report a case of acute pancreatitis (AP) occurring in a patient under treatment with carbamazepine (CBZ) for post-traumatic petit mal epilepsy, and review the current literature of drug-induced AP. The evidence of high plasmatic levels of CBZ and the absence of other aetiologic factors lead the authors to conclude that the overdose of CBZ could have represented the precipitating of the episode of acute pancreatitis.",0,0
1535,9184269,Methotrexate-induced pneumonitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis: report of five cases and review of the literature.,"Pneumonitis is emerging as one of the most unpredictable and potentially serious, adverse effects of treatment with MTX. Its prevalence in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been estimated from several retrospective and prospective studies to range from 0.3% to 18%. On the other hand, MTX-induced pneumonitis seems to be very rare in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Our review of 194 RA patients and 38 PsA patients receiving MTX has identified four RA patients and one PsA patient with MTX-induced pneumonitis, giving a prevalence of 2.1% and 0.03%, respectively. Diagnosis was suggested by clinical history and radiographic findings, but the bronchoalveolar lavage plays an important role both in excluding infectious agents and in providing information for understanding the pathogenesis of lung injury. The presence of a lymphocyte alveolitis with a predominance of CD4+ T cells in 3 RA patients and CD8+ T cells with a concomitant increase in neutrophils in another case suggests that immunologically mediated reactions may be one damage mechanism in MTX-induced pneumonitis. Although risk factors for MTX-induced pulmonary toxicity are poorly understood, the presence in 3 out of 5 of our patients of pre-existing lung disease, represented by diffuse interstitial changes on chest X-ray, and mild bronchial asthma in two RA patients and by pulmonary silicosis in the patient with PsA may account for a predisposition to the development of MTX pneumonitis.",1997,5
1536,91848,Hepatic angiosarcoma associated with androgenic-anabolic steroids.,"A retrospective epidemiological study of deaths from hepatic angiosarcoma (HAS) in the U.S. showed that during 1964--74 there were 168 such cases, of which 37 (22%) were associated with previously known causes (vinyl chloride, 'Thorotrast', and inorganic arsenic) and 4 (3.1%) of the remaining 131 cases with the use of androgenic-anabolic steroids. It is suggested that the long-term use of androgenic-anabolic steroids is the fourth cause of HAS, the majority of cases still being of unknown aetiology. Moreover, the presented cases serve as a link in a spectrum of hepatic disorders recently recognised to be caused by environmental agents such as vinyl chloride, arsenic, and thorotrast, and by contraceptive and anabolic steroids. Similar precursor stages, usually not recognised by clinical laboratory tests and consisting of areas of hyperplasia of hepatocytes and sinusoidal cells and sinusoidal dilatation, lead potentially to hepatic adenoma, carcinoma, peliosis, and angiosarcoma.",1979,11
1537,9191742,Ferrous sulfate-induced increase in requirement for thyroxine in a patient with primary hypothyroidism.,"Recent studies have shown that under experimental conditions ferrous sulfate may reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of orally administered levothyroxine sodium in patients with primary hypothyroidism. We describe a patient who became hypothyroid while taking ferrous sulfate. The hypothyroid status was corrected by increasing the dose of levothyroxine. Subsequently, when ferrous sulfate was discontinued, the patient became hyperthyroid while taking the higher dose of thyroid hormone preparation. Since both hypothyroidism and iron deficiency anemia may coexist, additional thyroid function testing is recommended in patients treated concurrently with ferrous sulfate and L-thyroxine.",1997,6
1538,9195619,Mental nerve neuropathy as a result of hepatitis B vaccination.,"We describe a 20-year-old woman who presented with polyarthralgia and sensory neuropathy, including mental nerve neuropathy. The symptoms were attributed to hepatitis B vaccination. This unusual cause of mental nerve neuropathy has not been previously described. However, as the use of hepatitis B vaccination is growing, adverse side effects, including mental nerve neuropathy, should be observed with an increased frequency.",1997,6
1539,9205466,Iatrogenic endometrial megapolyps in women with breast carcinoma.,"Tamoxifen, a widely used drug in adjuvant therapy of breast carcinoma, is now being tested for its effectiveness in chemoprevention. Although its side effects are few, tamoxifen increases the incidence of proliferative lesions of the endometrium, which theoretically should be preventable with progestational agents.
Two postmenopausal women treated with tamoxifen and progestational agents for breast carcinoma developed uterine enlargement and intermittent spotting. Hysterectomy revealed benign endometrial megapolyps with marked stromal decidualization and edema.
The value of multihormonal therapy in breast carcinoma is not established, and the addition of progestogens to tamoxifen may not reduce of developing endometrial lesions, including carcinoma. In both our cases, such a regimen did not prevent the occurrence of endometrial polyps which, although histologically benign, were usually large and thought clinically to be malignant. Periodic gynecologic assessment should be part of the follow-up of all women on long-term tamoxifen therapy.",1994,10
1540,9211543,Bleomycin and cyclophosphamide toxicity simulating metastatic nodules to the lungs in childhood cancer.,"Two pediatric oncology patients with Ewing's sarcoma and one with mixed germ cell tumor were treated with drug regimens that included bleomycin or cyclophosphamide. Despite progress to apparently complete remission, all manifested pulmonary nodules on computed tomography during or at the end of treatment. Thoracoscopic biopsy to confirm metastasis revealed instead fibrotic lesions apparently attributable to bleomycin or cyclophosphamide. After cessation of chemotherapy, the pulmonary lesions resolved and all three patients sustained their remissions. The case histories and comments on the diagnosis and management of pulmonary nodules are reviewed.",0,0
1541,921427,Circulating anticoagulant in the procainamide-induced lupus syndrome.,An elderly man with procainamide hydrochloride-induced lupus syndrome had a circulating anticoagulant against factor XI and a biologic false-positive (BFP) test result for syphilis. This was not associated with hemorrhagic problems. The activity of the circulating anticoagulant and the BFP disappeared within days following discontinuation of procainamide and the administration of corticosteroids.,1977,10
1542,9215418,Magnesium toxicosis in two horses.,"Magnesium sulfate, a saline laxative, is often used for treatment of intestinal impactions in horses. Clinical signs of hypermagnesemia are an uncommon complication following oral administration of magnesium sulfate. Overdose of magnesium sulfate in combination with renal insufficiency, hypocalcemia, or compromise of intestinal integrity may predispose horses to magnesium toxicosis. Establishment of diuresis with fluids and IV administration of calcium may provide successful treatment of magnesium toxicosis in horses.",1997,7
1543,9220046,Lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis possibly associated with clarithromycin and azithromycin.,"To describe two cases of rhabdomyolysis in patients taking lovastatin that were precipitated by the use of the newer macrolide antibiotics clarithromycin and azithromycin.
In each case, the patients were treated over 5 years with lovastatin and developed rhabdomyolysis that coincided with the completion of a prescribed regimen of a newer macrolide antibiotic. Following intravenous hydration and administration of bicarbonate, the patients' condition resolved without permanent' sequelae.
Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome resulting from the destruction of skeletal muscle that may progress to renal failure Several drugs have been associated with rhabdomyolysis, including lovastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor. Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that may increase the risk of lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis. To our knowledge, these cases are the first published reports of lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis associated with azithromycin and clarithromycin.
The risk of drug-induced rhabdomyolysis due to the potential interaction between lovastatin and azithromycin or clarithromycin should be considered before the concomitant use of these agents.",0,0
1544,9224230,Fulminant Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in 4 patients with dermatomyositis.,"Between 1989 and 1996, 4 cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) were observed in patients seronegative for the human immunodeficiency virus who were receiving corticosteroid therapy for dermatomyositis in our institution. These cases were considered unusual in light of the short delay of their onset after initiation of immunosuppressive therapy and their fulminant course: 3 of these patients died of PCP occurring during the first month of treatment with prednisone. In all 4 patients lymphopenia was observed before the initiation of corticosteroid treatment and low CD4 and CD8 cell counts were evident at the time of PCP. These observations support the view of an increase in both the severity and incidence of PCP in patients without human immunodeficiency virus infection and question the need for a primary prophylaxis in patients with connective tissue diseases receiving high-dose corticosteroid therapy.",1997,7
1545,9230324,Cardiopulmonary compromise after use of topical and submucosal alpha-agonists: possible added complication by the use of beta-blocker therapy.,"We report the specifics of 12 cases of severe hypertension after the intraoperative use of topical phenylephrine, submucosal epinephrine, or both. Ten of these 12 patients also developed severe pulmonary edema. Seven of the twelve were treated with beta blockers; 3 of whom suffered cardiac arrest. We propose a common mechanism: the vasoconstrictors caused systemic hypertension, increased left ventricular afterload, decreased left ventricular compliance, and decreased cardiac output. In those patients treated with beta blockers, decreased contractility and inability to increase heart rate further compromised cardiopulmonary function.",1997,7
1546,9232614,Acute leukaemia during tamoxifen therapy.,"Tamoxifen treatment is a proven therapy for breast cancer that produces a survival advantage when used as an adjuvant, and reduces the incidence of recurrences and controlateral tumor evolution. Although this therapy has a very low toxicity profile, an increase in secondary cancers has been reported. Tamoxifen is suggested to be carcinogenic both through direct genotoxic and epigenetic mechanisms. It is activated by cytochrome P450 to form reactive metabolites that bind covalently to DNA to create adducts. We report two cases that developed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) during tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer.",1997,3
1547,9240497,Relapse in the external auditory canal of acute promyelocytic leukemia after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid.,"A 54-year-old female was admitted to our hospital for gingival bleeding and was diagnosed as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). She received induction therapy according to the AML92 protocol of the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG) with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus chemotherapeutic agents. She achieved complete remission, but one year later had a relapse in her external auditory canal without leukemic cell in the bone marrow. Extramedullary disease is rare in APL. This case suggests the importance of careful observation for extramedullary relapse in patients who are treated with ATRA.",1997,7
1548,9247841,Propylthiouracil-induced cutaneous vasculitis.,Cutaneous reactions to propylthiouracil and methimazole occur in 3%-5% of adults. Generalized maculopapular and papular purpuric eruptions are perhaps the most common thionamide-induced reactions. We report 3 patients who developed cutaneous vasculitis which is a rare and serious side-effect during antithyroid drug therapy. The observation of cutaneous vasculitis during administration of propylthiouracil suggested that clinical awareness of this complication should be of considerable importance.,1997,7
1549,9253492,Heat stroke-like episode in a child caused by zonisamide.,"A 2-year-old mentally retarded boy with frontal lobe epilepsy presented with an episode that resembled heat stroke during the administration of zonisamide. He developed hyperpyrexia with oligohidrosis and central neurological symptoms, including, chorea-like involuntary movements, resting tremor, and cogwheel rigidity. A sweat test using pilocarpine iontophoresis revealed a marked reduction in the sweat response, which suggested a postganglionic sweating dysfunction. A skin biopsy examined by light and electron microscopy showed no morphological abnormality in the sweat glands. The oligohidrosis caused by zonisamide was reversible in that the patient regained the ability to sweat within 2 weeks of the cessation of drug administration. Children receiving zonisamide should be monitored for oligohidrosis and the development of neurological symptoms associated with an elevation of body temperature.",1997,7
1550,9256906,Acute renal failure in a patient receiving treatment with suramin.,Suramin has demonstrated modest activity against prostate cancer and is being investigated in clinical trials. We describe a patient with metastatic prostate cancer who developed nonoliguric renal failure during treatment with suramin. Other potential causes of renal failure were not present in our patient and his renal function gradually recovered with the cessation of suramin treatment. Acute renal failure should be recognized as a potential complication of suramin treatment.,1997,8
1551,9260733,Clozapine induced polyserositis.,"Clozapine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1989 for treatment of severely ill schizophrenic patients. It has activity against both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which has made it an alternative to traditional antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol. However, clozapine must be used cautiously due to its side effect profile. These side effects include agranulocytosis, seizures, and cardiorespiratory symptoms. We report the case of a patient who developed polyserositis (pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and pericarditis) after being started on clozapine, and whose symptoms remitted upon discontinuation of clozapine. The literature is reviewed and the treatment implications are discussed.",1997,8
1552,9279731,A case of recurrent Candida parapsilosis prosthetic valve endocarditis: cure by medical treatment alone.,"A patient with recurrent fungal endocarditis on prosthetic mitral valve is presented. Candida parapsilosis was the causative agent. The patient was treated medically with conventional amphotericin during the first episode. When the disease recurred conventional amphotericin B was used again, but had to be stopped because of severe side effects. Treatment was continued with amphotericin B colloidal dispersion, followed by fluconazole for 8 months. The patient is healthy 16 months after discontinuation of fluconazole. Medical treatment of fungal endocarditis on prosthetic valves can be successful in selected cases.",1997,7
1553,9291634,Rhabdomyolysis in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"The objective of this paper is to report 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis (RML) in patients with acute leukemia (AL). This occurred consecutively after the administration of chemotherapy, during the ensuing period of myelosuppression. Thirty-six patients with AL received, in a three-month period, 51 cycles of combined chemotherapy which included, in all of them, cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C); among them, along with myelosuppression, five experienced fever, infectious complications, gastrointestinal tract symptoms and severe myalgias. Serum creatine kinase (CK), liver function tests and a light microscopy muscle biopsy were performed on all of them. Ten-17 days after receiving chemotherapy, five patients (4 males and 1 female) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed incapacitating myalgias in neck, thighs and arms. CK and/or alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were increased 5-24 times above the normal range in four of these patients, and the muscle biopsy showed focal RML in all five. Myalgias were self-limited and lasted 4-10 days. In addition to the chemotherapy, other factors known to be capable of producing RML, such as sepsis, other medications, and dehydration were found. In conclusion, myalgias were due to focal RML produced probably by a combination of factors, particularly the chemotherapy along with dehydration due to gastrointestinal complications, infection, and the use of diverse antibiotics. The endemic nature of the finding in such a short period of time is outstanding.",1997,0
1554,9302445,Hypercalcemia in an AIDS patient treated with growth hormone.,"Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) is a newly approved treatment for weight loss and wasting in patients with AIDS. We report a male patient with advanced AIDS who developed hypercalcemia 2 weeks after institution of rhGH therapy.
Parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone-related peptide and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were suppressed, suggesting that hypercalcemia was mediated through alternative mechanisms. The hypercalcemia responded to discontinuation of rhGH and a single dose of intravenous pamidronate disodium and has not recurred in 8 months of follow-up.
We believe this to be the first reported case of rhGH-induced hypercalcemia in an HIV-infected patient.",1997,9
1555,9311175,Hypersensitivity reactions to cisplatin following multiple uncomplicated courses: a report on two cases.,"Two patients with ovarian cancer who had received multiple courses of cisplatin without complications experienced hypersensitivity reactions to cisplatin: one, involving intrahepatic artery infusion, manifested general erythema, dyspnea, and hypotension; the other, involving intravenous infusion, manifested abdominal pain, general erythema, and fever. When platinum-containing agents are administered, patients should be closely monitored for hypersensitivity reactions, even in previously uncomplicated cases.",1997,8
1556,9315405,Cisplatin and acute tubular necrosis.,"We report an unusually short lived and asymptomatic episode of severe cisplatin-induced renal tubular salt wasting in a fit 41-year-old patient with malignant teratoma. This was associated with polyuria but no significant hyponatraemia. Full recovery occurred because of early pick up, emphasizing the need for careful fluid balance monitoring of patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy.",1997,0
1557,9337441,Phenolphthalein-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis.,"To report a case of phenolphthalein-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in a patient maintained on several other medications more commonly known to be associated with TEN.
A 78-year-old white man presented with intractable lower back pain and constipation. On day 1 of admission, the patient exhibited a diffuse urticarial rash over his trunk and extremities. History revealed that the patient had taken a combination phenolphthalein/docusate sodium (Correctol) over-the-counter laxative 1 day prior to admission. He had a similar urticarial rash 1.5 years earlier with this product and was instructed not to use it. A biopsy was performed and evidence from light microscopic analysis of the tissue led to a diagnosis of TEN. Furosemide, spironolactone, allopurinol, and hydroxyurea were considered possible causes of the reaction and were discontinued. Despite this, the lesions worsened in severity. The patient subsequently responded well to intravenous antibiotics, intravenous corticosteroids, and local wound care. Furosemide, spironolactone, hydroxyurea, allopurinol, and docusate were all reintroduced without reactivation of the lesions.
Phenolphthalein is the active ingredient in several over-the-counter laxative preparations and has only rarely been reported to cause TEN. (It is no longer contained in Correctol.) To our knowledge, this case report represents only the third description of laxative-induced TEN. Although this patient had been exposed to several other medications more commonly associated with TEN, his long-term tolerance of and uneventful rechallenge with these medications exclude them as potential catalysts to this drug reaction. The patient's previous rash and the temporal relation of this event and the ingestion of phenolphthalein, as well as the similarity of this case to other reports, point to phenolphthalein as the cause of TEN in this patient.
TEN is a rare disorder that can be fatal in up to 30% of patients. Clinicians should include phenolphthalein in their list of possible causes of drug-induced TEN. A careful and complete medication history can help avoid unnecessary discontinuation of clinically important medications and inadvertent rechallenge with the causative agent.",1997,10
1558,9347384,Carbamazepine toxicity induced by clarithromycin coadministration in psychiatric patients.,"Seven psychiatric inpatients receiving carbamazepine 600 mg/day were coadministered clarithromycin 400 mg/day for 5 days to treat atypical pneumonia. Blood samples were taken after clarithromycin coadministration and at 1 and 4 weeks after its discontinuation. Plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. During clarithromycin coadministration, four out of the seven patients developed moderate-to-severe toxic symptoms of carbamazepine, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and ataxia, which resolved within 5 days after clarithromycin discontinuation. In these four patients, plasma carbamazepine concentrations after clarithromycin coadministration were approximately twice as high as those after its discontinuation. In the seven patients, the mean plasma concentration of carbamazepine, but not of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, after clarithromycin coadministration was significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those at 1 and 4 weeks after its discontinuation. The present report suggests that clarithromycin coadministration induces increased plasma carbamazepine concentrations, which may result in carbamazepine toxicity. Therefore, care should be given to prescribing clarithromycin for patients receiving carbamazepine.",1997,7
1559,9352164,Acute hemorrhagic gastritis associated with acetazolamide intoxication in a patient with chronic renal failure.,"Acetazolamide (Diamox) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor commonly used in patients with glaucoma in order to reduce intraocular pressure. Acetazolamide (AZ) is mostly excreted in the urine, therefore, the blood levels of AZ often tend to increase in patients with chronic renal failure. We experienced a case of chronic renal failure in a patient suffering from acute hemorrhagic gastritis associated with AZ intoxication. A 66-year-old female with chronic renal failure was referred to our hospital because of drowsiness and an acute deterioration of renal function. She had been treated with AZ, 500 mg per every day for eleven days for the treatment of glaucoma. Laboratory studies showed leukocyturia, thrombocytopenia, severe anemia, and tarry stools. The serum concentration of AZ was elevated to a maximum of 76.5 mg/ml. She was thus diagnosed as having AZ intoxication. On further examination, acute extensive hemorrhagic gastritis was also found by gastroscopy. Despite of the administration of intensive therapies, she died of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and septic shock due to bone marrow depression 6 days after admission. It is generally known that excessive blood levels of AZ inhibit not only the gastric juices but also prostaglandin levels and HCO3- excretion in the gastric mucosal barrier. We thus concluded that an excessive dose of AZ had probably destroyed the gastric mucosal barrier or thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow disorder and thus eventually led to the development of hemorrhagic gastritis. As far as we know, this is the first case report of acute hemorrhagic gastritis associated with AZ intoxication. Even though AZ tends to strongly bind to plasma protein and its clearance is generally poor by hemodialysis (HD), in our patient, HD was observed to be rather effective since the clearance of AZ was 45.8 ml/min on HD and 66 ml/min on direct hemoperfusion (DHP). DHP often reduces the number of platelets, also DHP needs a lot of heparin, therefore, we should have performed HD alone instead of DHP. In patients with an impaired renal function, AZ should therefore be administered very carefully in order to avoid an accumulation of the drug. In addition, HD alone should be used to remove any excessive amounts of AZ from the blood.",1997,10

1561,9362107,Danazol induced thrombocytopenia.,"A 34-year-old woman with a left ovarian cyst (clinically diagnosed as endometrial cyst) was treated with 400 mg of danazol per day. On the next day, after a total dose of only 600 mg of danazol, gingival bleeding and purpura occurred. Her laboratory findings were as follows: platelet count 1000/ mm3 hematocrit 39%, WBC 7300/mm3 and RBC 466 x 10(4)/mm3. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) was diagnosed, and she was treated with 40 mg of methylprednisolone per day for 19 days. Her platelet count increased to 130,000/ mm3. Her left ovarian cyst was extirpated surgically, and the histological diagnosis was endometrial cyst. Danazol at 400 mg per day was therefore again administered. On the next day, she complained of gingival bleeding and purpura again, and her platelet count was 5000/mm3. We diagnosed this case as danazol induced thrombocytopenia.",1997,7
1562,9366852,Skin necrosis secondary to low-molecular weight heparin in a patient with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.,Skin necrosis is a rare complication of subcutaneous heparin therapy that usually occurs at injection sites. It occasionally accompanies the heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome. We describe a patient with the antiphospholipid syndrome who had skin necrosis develop from low-molecular weight heparin therapy at sites distant from injection sites.,1997,11
1563,937377,Clinical toxicity of reserpine in hospitalized patients: a report from the Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program.,"Adverse reactions to reserpine were studied in 231 hospitalized medical patients who received the drug. Reserpine was administered specifically for hypertension in 91.3 percent of patients; 35.5 per cent of patients received the drug by intramuscular (IM) injection. The IM route of administration was associated with higher mean daily doses (1.28 +/- 0.14 mg/day) than was oral administration (0.37 +/- 0.02 mg/day). Adverse reactions to reserpine were reported in 26 patients (11.3 per cent), but only three of these reactions were considered life-threatening and no deaths were attributed to the drug. Central nervous system (CNS) disturbances, reported in 12 patients, were the most common unwanted effects. Gastrointestinal disturbances were reported in six patients, and hypotension in six. Toxicity occurred more frequently in those who received IM, and therefore high-dose, reserpine. Adverse reactions also were more common in patients who had not received rauwolfia derivatives prior to admission; however, this group of patients also received IM reserpine more frequently. Finally, reserpine toxicity, in particular central nervous system (CNS) disturbances, was reported more frequently in patients also receiving barbiturates, suggesting additive CNS effects.",0,0
1564,9375469,A case of contact dermatitis due to sodium bisulfite in an ophthalmic solution.,"We report a case of contact dermatitis due to sodium bisulfite in Tathion eye drops. A 72-year-old woman was treated daily with two solutions including Tathion eye drops for senile cataract for two years and three months. She developed edema, swelling, erythema, and vesicles on her eyelids. Because contact dermatitis due to a topical medication was suspected, patch testing was performed after disappearance of her eruption. A positive reaction to sodium bisulfite in Tathion eye drops was confirmed. Therefore, we diagnosed her eruption as contact dermatitis due to sodium bisulfite. The reaction to sodium sulfite in the next patch testing was negative. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report from Japan about contact dermatitis caused by this medication.",1997,10
1565,9399776,Acute pancreatitis after long-term 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy.,"Acute pancreatitis is a known, although rare, complication of mesalamine treatment. This complication typically appears within the first days or weeks after initiation of therapy. We describe two cases of acute pancreatitis that occurred after long term mesalamine therapy for ulcerative colitis. A rechallenge, performed in both patients, confirmed the diagnosis of mesalamine-induced pancreatitis. These case reports provide evidence that 5-aminosalicylic acid may induce acute pancreatitis after long term treatment.",1997,12
1566,9403220,Acute renal failure with severe tubulointerstitial changes in a patient with minimal change nephrotic syndrome treated with enalapril.,"A 35-year-old nephrotic man developed acute renal failure with serum creatinine to 1543 micromol/l after a month of therapy with enalapril. Renal biopsy demonstrated minimal glomerular changes with fusion of podocytes, tubular necrosis with regeneration of tubular epithelial cells, interstitial edema with focal interstitial fibrosis, and interstitial infiltration with neutrophils, eosinophils, plasma cells and mononuclear cells. Three hemodialyses were performed in the patient during the oliguric phase of the disease. Renal function was restored after withdrawal of enalapril and initiation of steroid therapy. Steroids also contributed to the improvement of the nephrotic syndrome and proteinuria decreased from maximal ranges of 27 g/l to 2.2 g/l after six months of the follow-up. Similar cases were previously described associated with captopril treatment, but not with enalapril.",1997,11
1567,9407188,Early ritonavir-induced maculopapular eruption.,"We report 2 cases of maculopapular eruption and fever in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the 2nd day of first administration of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor. In the 1st patient, clinical improvement occurred despite continuation of therapy, and in the 2nd the treatment was stopped with remission and rechallenge resulting in recurrence. Ritonavir should be added to the list of drugs that can induce adverse cutaneous reactions in HIV patients.",1997,0
1568,941054,Nephropathy caused by methicillin therapy for staphylococcal septicemia.,"Nephropathy, eosinophilia and fever were observed in an 18-year-old man being treated for staphylococcal septicemia. Parenteral challenge with suspected sensitizing agents confirmed methicillin as the likely offender. Review of the literature relating to methicillin-induced nephropathy suggests a hypersensitivity origin for this disorder, but immunologic and ultrastructural investigation to date has failed to elucidate pathogenesis.",1976,7
1569,9413296,Methysergide-induced retroperitoneal fibrosis: successful outcome and two new laboratory features.,"A 25-year-old woman sought medical attention because of iliocaval manifestations of retroperitoneal fibrosis while she was taking methysergide. Laboratory studies yielded substantially increased serum procollagen III levels and anticardiolipin antibodies accompanied with anti-beta(2) glycoprotein I, findings not previously described with this disorder. Clinical and laboratory manifestations resolved after cessation of methysergide therapy.",1997,12
1570,9426968,Vitiligo associated with alpha-interferon in a patient with chronic active hepatitis C.,We report a case of vitiligo that occurred during the second month of interferon alpha 2a therapy for chronic active hepatitis C. The patient received the interferon for four months.,1997,12
1571,9433539,Agranulocytosis associated with ticlopidine: a possible benefit with filgastim.,"Ticlopidine is an oral antiplatelet agent frequently utilized in the treatment of cerebrovascular disease and is rarely associated with severe bone marrow suppression, typically aplastic anemia. Reports in the literature of isolated agranulocytosis are few, although they may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A case is reported of an elderly woman who developed febrile agranulocytosis several weeks after commencing ticlopidine but who had a favorable outcome after cessation of that drug and treatment with filgastrim.",0,0
1572,9443627,"Toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and in vitro hemodialysis clearance of ifosfamide and metabolites in an anephric pediatric patient with Wilms' tumor.","We evaluated the in vitro hemodialysis ratio and subsequent toxicity and pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide in an anephric patient with Wilms' tumor.
An in vitro model was used to determine the extraction ratio of ifosfamide by dialysis. The toxicity and plasma concentrations of ifosfamide, chloroacetaldehyde, and 4-hydroxyifosfamide were then determined over 24 h after a single 1.6 g/m2 dose of ifosfamide. Plasma concentrations were also measured before and after ten dialysis sessions during four courses of ifosfamide therapy.
The in vitro hemodialysis model showed that ifosfamide was cleared with an extraction ratio of 86.7+/-0.5% and remained constant even at low concentrations of drug. The mean decrease in vivo following hemodialysis for ifosfamide, chloroacetaldehyde, and 4-hydroxyifosfamide were 86.9%, 77.2%, and 36.2%, respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters for ifosfamide using model-independent methods were calculated: Vd = 0.23 l/kg, t1/2 = 4.8 h, and ClT = 3.30 l/h per m2. Ifosfamide-associated neurotoxicity was noted within hours of drug administration and improved rapidly following hemodialysis.
The results of our study suggest that the pharmacokinetics of parent ifosfamide may not be substantially altered in patients with renal failure. Hemodialysis was shown to remove ifosfamide, chloroacetaldehyde, and 4-hydroxyifosfamide from the blood stream. Hemodialysis was also shown to reverse ifosfamide-related neurotoxicity.",1998,0
1573,946400,Methyldopa-induced liver injury. Rapid progression to fatal postnecrotic cirrhosis.,"A 55-year-old woman developed symptoms suggestive of hepatitis 12 weeks after first receiving methyldopa for hypertension. Liver biopsy showed chronic aggressive hepatitis with subacute hepatic necrosis. Methyldopa was discontinued, but after exhibiting transient clinical improvement, the patient's condition progressively deteriorated until she died of hepatic failure, in spite of therapy with massive doses of corticosteroids and other nonspecific measures. During the terminal stage, a considerable decrease in the size of the liver was observed. At autopsy, the liver was found to be small, shrunken, and scarred; histological sections demonstrated postnecrotic cirrhosis. Such a rapid and relentless progression of methyldopa-induced liver injury is undoubtedly rare, but it may be prevented by careful supervision of patients who exhibit liver function abnormalities early in the course of therapy.",1976,3
1574,9466030,Acute respiratory depression as a complication of nebulised morphine.,"To present a case of respiratory depression following the administration of nebulised morphine.
A 74-yr-old, 51-kg woman with a history of hypertension controlled with 5 mg.day-1 enalapril and 50 mg.day-1 atenolol was admitted for evaluation of low back pain, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Investigation revealed advanced metastatic disease with a probable primary in the right lung. The patient's pain was well controlled with 10 mg continuous release morphine p.o. three times daily, and 10 mg immediate release morphine p.o. for breakthrough pain as required. During the two weeks following the commencement of this treatment she occasionally complained of shortness of breath. Examination revealed a fully conscious patient with slight dyspnoea and mild wheezing which responded to oxygen 30% and nebulised bronchodilators. An oncological consultation recommended 4 mg nebulised morphine and 4 mg dexamethasone in saline as treatment for the bouts of breathlessness. Approximately 15 min after the first administration of nebulised morphine the patient became markedly bradypneic (respiratory rate: 4-5 bpm), hypotensive (BP 70/40 mmHg), and responded only partially to command. The pupils were pinpoint. The trachea was immediately intubated and the lungs ventilated with oxygen 40% for four hours. Following this occurrence of respiratory depression nebulised morphine was discontinued and no further events occurred.
Patients receiving inhaled morphine should be closely monitored and resuscitation equipment should be readily available.",1998,1
1575,9476721,Acute dystonia with thalamic and brainstem lesions after initial penicillamine treatment in Wilson's disease.,"Dystonia is a common manifestation in Wilson's disease (WD). The striatum, especially the putamen, has been considered to be responsible for dystonia. We reported 3 patients who developed acute generalized dystonia and akinetic rigid syndrome following an initial therapy with d-penicillamine 125-500 mg daily. Brain MRI revealed lesions in the thalamus and the brainstem, particularly the tegmentum, and the basis pontis in addition to the basal ganglion lesions. After the episode, 1 patient continued to receive d-penicillamine therapy and 2 changed to zinc sulfate treatment. The generalized dystonia improved in the following 3 months and 3 years respectively in 2 patients. Follow-up brain MRI of these 2 patients revealed that the lesions in the thalamus and brainstem disappeared or resolved almost completely. From these data, acute generalized dystonia with brainstem and thalamic lesions may occur in WD patients after an initial d-penicillamine therapy. Furthermore, the dystonia may resolve following the disappearance of the brainstem and thalamic lesions.",1998,0
1576,9491301,Ballistic movements due to ischemic infarcts after intravenous heroin overdose: report of two cases.,"Stroke is an infrequent but recognized complication of heroin addiction. Two heroin addicts, aged 34 and 19 years, developed ballistic movements after intravenous heroin overdose. Patient 1 presented bilateral ballism 1 week after intravenous heroin injection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral ischemic lesions of the globus pallidus, suggesting a generalized cerebral hypoxia during the comatose state as pathogenic mechanism. Patient 2 presented an acute left hemiballismus when consciousness was restored with naloxone. MRI demonstrated an ischemic infarct in the right striatum. An embolic mechanism of stroke was suspected in this patient, considering the normal results of blood analysis, echocardiogram and cerebral arteriograms. Ballistic movements ceased after administration of haloperidol; both patients remained without abnormal movements thereafter.",1997,12
1577,9494448,Anaphylaxis to intravenous cyclosporine and tolerance to oral cyclosporine: case report and review.,"Hypersensitivity reactions to cyclosporine are rare. The mechanism of the reaction and guidelines for subsequent use of cyclosporine are not well defined.
To investigate the mechanisms involved in hypersensitivity reactions to cyclosporine and determine the feasibility of future cyclosporine use.
We report a patient who had an anaphylactic reaction during the intravenous infusion of cyclosporine. Skin-prick tests were performed for the antibiotics he received earlier in the day and the cyclosporine. A MEDLINE search identified all the reported cases of hypersensitivity reactions to cyclosporine. Each was analyzed to determine a mechanism of the hypersensitivity reaction and subsequent management outcomes.
Intradermal tests to intravenous cyclosporine formulation (1 mg/mL) were positive in the patient and negative in two controls. There was no reaction to the antibiotics. The literature search revealed 22 cases of hypersensitivity reaction to cyclosporine. The clinical setting and diagnostic evaluation suggest multiple mechanisms for the hypersensitivity response. All seven patients who were given an oral formulation of cyclosporine tolerated it well after a reaction to the intravenous infusion. Two patients who initially reacted to an oral solution formulation subsequently tolerated the corn oil-based soft gelatin capsule.
Hypersensitivity reactions to cyclosporine are due to Cremophor EL. There is direct and indirect evidence for various immunologic and nonimmunologic pathways precipitating the reaction. This case suggests a role for IgE in the hypersensitivity reaction. Fortunately, a hypersensitivity reaction to one formulation of cyclosporine does not preclude use of a different formulation. The corn oil-based soft gelatin capsule appears to be the safest formulation.",1998,2

1579,9509511,Veno-occlusive disease-like hepatotoxicity in two children receiving chemotherapy for Wilms' tumor and clear cell sarcoma of kidney.,"We report two pediatric cases who developed veno-occlusive disease-like hepatotoxicity while receiving chemotherapy for Wilms' tumor and clear cell sarcoma of kidney. The chemotherapeutics, including vincristine, actinomycin D, and epirubicin in case 1 and vincristine and actinomycin D in case 2, were given before the hepatotoxicity developed. Other possible causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded. Recovery was observed with supportive therapy after 2 and 1 weeks, respectively. After recovery, the children tolerated continued chemotherapy without any decrease in the doses of drugs. We conclude that vincristine and actinomycin D were the cause of this rare from of hepatotoxicity and that chemotherapy for the underlying malignant disease could be given safely after clinical recovery.",0,0
1580,9512187,Raynaud's phenomenon and acral necrosis after chemotherapy for AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.,"Raynaud's phenomenon is a common vascular side effect of chemotherapy drug regimens. Chemotherapy-induced Raynaud's phenomenon leading to acral gangrene has rarely been reported. In this report, one patient who developed gangrene after bleomycin and vincristine/vinblastine chemotherapy for AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and another HIV-infected patient who exhibited symptoms of severe Raynaud's phenomenon related to the same regimen are presented. Because the combination of bleomycin and vinca alkaloids is commonly used for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, clinicians should be aware of the risk of provoking acral necrosis in patients who develop Raynaud's phenomenon under chemotherapy. The literature is reviewed, and clinical symptoms, pathophysiology, and treatment options are discussed.",1998,1
1581,9517515,Development of essential thrombocythemia in a patient treated with interferon alfa and pentostatin for hairy cell leukemia.,A patient is reported who developed essential thrombocythemia after successful treatment for hairy cell leukemia. He was initially treated with interferon alfa and subsequently relapsed within one year of treatment. His diagnosis was reconfirmed and then treated with Pentostatin. Six years after treatment he had a progressive increase in the platelet count and was diagnosed as essential thrombocythemia. Second cancers including various types of hematological malignancy have been reported in patients with hairy cell leukemia treated with chemotherapy or interferon alfa. These malignancies may represent either a new clonal disorder or a complication of drug treatment. This is the first report of a chronic myeloproliferative disorder following successful treatment of hairy cell leukemia.,1998,1
1582,9527943,Effect of beta-blockade on symptomatic dexamethasone-induced hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in premature infants: three case reports and literature review.,"The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of beta-blockade on clinically significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in premature infants treated with dexamethasone because of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
Case reports are presented of three premature infants (mean gestational age 27 weeks) cared for in the intensive care nursery in whom clinically significant septal hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction developed during dexamethasone treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The infants were treated with oral propranolol. Serial physiologic and echocardiographic parameters were followed. Physiologic data were analyzed with an analysis of variance, with the Kruskal-Wallis test used for nonparametric data. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Oral administration of the beta-blocker propranolol resulted in clinical and echocardiographic improvement of the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. One patient had a lower average heart rate and two patients had lower average mean blood pressure values during propranolol treatment, none of which was clinically significant. None of the patients had worsening of the respiratory status.
beta-blockade treatment was well tolerated and may be beneficial in relieving symptomatic steroid-induced left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in premature infants.",0,0
1583,9533061,Clostridium difficile toxin-induced colitis after use of clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream.,"To report a case of toxin-positive Clostridium difficile-induced colitis (CDIC) after use of clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream.
A 25-year-old postpartum white woman developed multiple watery stools and abdominal cramping on day 6 of therapy with clindamycin vaginal cream for bacterial vaginosis. She received no other concomitant medications. The patient's stool sample was found to be positive for the C. difficile toxin. Due to the costs and risks of standard therapy, we decided to manage the patient supportively. Complete resolution of the diarrhea occurred shortly thereafter.
No published clinical studies in patients receiving clindamycin vaginal cream for bacterial vaginosis have documented C. difficile toxin in stool samples of patients with diarrhea. Approximately 5-6% of intravaginal clindamycin is absorbed in the bloodstream, making systemic effects possible.
This report indicates clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream as the most probable cause of CDIC due to the temporal relationship between the occurrence of diarrhea and clindamycin administration, lack of concomitant medications, and documentation of C. difficile toxin.",1998,3
1584,9545161,Fatal toxic epidermal necrolysis related to lamotrigine administration.,"Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are severe life-threatening dermatologic conditions. To date, eight cases of TEN and one of SJS related to lamotrigine administration have been reported in the literature. Most patients were also taking concomitant valproic acid. It was hypothesized that valproic acid may interfere with glucuronidation of lamotrigine, leading to increased serum lamotrigine levels, or perhaps alter the drug's metabolism, resulting in accumulation of a toxic intermediate metabolite. Ultimately, this may possibly predispose a patient to increased dermatologic reactions, including TEN. A 54-year-old man developed TEN 4 weeks after beginning lamotrigine for complex partial seizures related to a glioblastoma multiforme brain tumor. The patient had also been taking concomitant allopurinol and captopril for more than 4 years with no complications, and valproic acid 3 months before the cutaneous event. Despite aggressive intensive care management, the patient died 17 days from the onset of symptoms due to multiple organ failure. Administration of lamotrigine, especially in combination with valproic acid, may lead to the development of TEN.",0,0
1585,9550246,A syndrome of increased affect in response to risperidone among patients with schizophrenia.,"Six of 13 outpatients with schizophrenia who participated in a ten-week open trial of risperidone had an initial good response to the medication followed by development of intolerable affect, including feelings of agitation and depression and periods of crying and insomnia. Patients who developed this syndrome did not differ from other patients in baseline ratings on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, except that patients who developed the syndrome had a significantly higher mean baseline rating on the BPRS anxiety subscale. The authors suggest that risperidone may increase affect in patients with schizophrenia and that some patients, especially those with anxiety, may have difficulty managing the increase.",1998,4
1586,9554064,Putaminal infarct in methanol intoxication: case report and role of brain imaging studies.,"Methanol toxicity can cause severe central nervous system insult in which a characteristic pattern of bilateral putaminal injury is noted on brain imaging studies. We present a fatal case of subacute methanol toxicity with associated diffuse brain involvement, including bilateral putaminal necrosis and cerebral edema with ventricular compression. Theoretical basal ganglia toxicologic mechanisms of methanol poisoning are reviewed, and the role of brain imaging studies will regard to diagnosis, prognosis and impact on management is discussed.",1998,4
1587,9562211,Risperidone-induced tardive dyskinesia.,This report presents a potential case of risperidone-induced tardive dyskinesia. A 28 year old white schizophrenic male has been under risperidone monotherapy for about one year when he developed dyskinetic movements. There was only a short term exposure to classic antipsychotics prior to risperidone administration.,1998,3
1588,9579301,Increased ocular pressure in two patients with narrow angle glaucoma treated with venlafaxine.,"Venlafaxine blocks the specific monoamine transporters and is devoid of significant action on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. To our knowledge, no cases of glaucoma have been reported so far. Because pain perception involves both serotonergic and noradrenergic mechanisms, venlafaxine also may be useful in neuropathic pain therapy. We report on two patients with narrow angle glaucoma affected by chronic pain. When venlafaxine treatment was begun, their ocular pressure was steadily around 17-18 mmHg. Venlafaxine was chosen (daily dose 75 mg) because this drug is claimed not to bind on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. However, 4 days later the ocular pressure of the first patient increased to 22 mmHg, which led to suspension of the drug. The ocular pressure of the second patient was 18.5 mmHg after a week, 21 mmHg after 2 weeks, and 23 mmHg after 16 days. One week after suspension, ocular pressure of the patients was 17 and 18 mmHg, respectively. Possible explanations of this ocular effect are offered: pharmacokinetic interference on the drugs used in glaucoma treatment, in vivo action on the muscarinic receptor, indirect effect via dopaminergic receptors, or direct effect on the ocular sympathetic postganglionic neurones. In any case, from a clinical viewpoint, caution should be used when giving venlafaxine to patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, and ocular pressure must be monitored.",0,0
1589,95811,Glomerulonephritis in procainamide induced lupus erythematosus: report of a case and review of the literature.,"A 61-year-old man developed clinical lupus syndrome with positive antinuclear antibody, positive lupus erythematosus (LE) cell preparation, and diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis following 26 months of procainamide therapy. He was treated sequentially with prednisone and azathioprine (2 weeks), decreasing doses of prednisone alone (21 months), and no immunosuppressive drugs (10 months). Coincidental with this treatment, the immunopathology of the glomerulonephritis improved dramatically, dramatically, renal function returned almost to normal, and both antinuclear antibody and LE cell preparation became negative. The course of this patient's renal disease contrasts sharply with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis of idiopathic systemic lupus, and suggests that this rare complication of procainamide therapy may have a favorable course.",1979,4
1590,9602881,Drug-induced linear IgA disease with antibodies to collagen VII.,"Linear IgA disease (LAD) is characterized by circulating and tissue-bound IgA antibodies against heterogeneous antigens in the cutaneous basement membrane zone. In most cases the cause is unknown, but a minority of cases has been drug induced. We report a 76-year-old man who developed an acute blistering eruption following high-dose penicillin treatment for pneumococcal septicaemia. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated dermal binding IgA antibodies, and Western blotting of serum showed reactivity with a 250 kDa dermal antigen corresponding to collagen VII of anchoring fibrils. Indirect immunoelectron microscopy showed antibody labelling in the lamina densa and sublamina densa zone. This is one of the few cases of drug-induced LAD in which the target antigen profile has been characterized, and the first in which the antigen has been shown to correspond to collagen VII.",1998,2
1591,961329,Suxamethonium apnoea terminated with commercial serumcholinesterase.,"A case of prolonged suxamethonium apnoea successfully terminated by the infusion of a commercial preparation of serumcholinesterase is reported. The patient appeared to be homozygous for the dibucaine resistant gene, having only 15% of normal activity in his serum. His dibucaine number was 21, and the Michaelis constant was 5.5 times that of normal sera. One and a half hours after receiving 110 mg suxamethonium for oesophagoscopy, the patient was still apnoeic with no response to ulnar nerve stimulation. Intravenous administration of 90 mg commercial serumcholinesterase, the equivalent to 1000 ml fresh human plasma, restored twitch and tetanic responses and the patient could lift his head 15 min after the beginning of the enzyme injection. The serumcholinesterase activity of the patient's serum increased by 55% (from 15% to 70%) following the injection. This rise was halved over the next 8 days.",1976,0
1592,9619226,Cardiac arrest associated with sulprostone use during caesarean section.,"Sulprostone, a synthetic prostaglandin with potent uterotonic action, has been shown to have a low complication rate in a large series. We present a case in which a bolus intravenous injection of sulprostone 30 micrograms was administered to treat postpartum haemorrhage during caesarean section. The 38-year-old patient with no previous cardiac or smoking history developed complete heart block, ventricular fibrillation and subsequent asystole. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was successful after 45 minutes. Post resuscitation there was no myocardial infarction and she had complete neurological recovery. We postulate that the bolus of sulprostone resulted in possible coronary spasm that resulted in cardiac arrest.",1998,6
1593,9627209,Lamotrigine toxicity secondary to sertraline.,"Blood level monitoring helps to determine the therapeutic and toxic ranges for anticonvulsants and antidepressants. We investigated initial drug-drug interactions between lamotrigine and sertraline. We report on case histories of two epileptic patients who were initially on lamotrigine and to whom sertraline was added to control psychiatric features. In case 1, a total daily dose of 25 mg sertraline, with nondetectable sertraline and desmethylsertraline blood levels, resulted in a doubling of the lamotrigine blood level with symptoms of toxicity. In case 2, a 25 mg reduction in the total daily dose of sertraline resulted in halving of the lamotrigine blood level even though the lamotrigine dosage was increased by 33%. This shows that sertraline has potent interactions with lamotrigine metabolism. The authors hypothesize that inhibition of glucuronidation is responsible. Clinicians are advised to observe for symptoms of toxicity and to do serial blood levels to monitor this interaction.",1998,4
1594,9634122,Prolonged prostate-specific antigen response in flutamide withdrawal syndrome despite disease progression.,"Flutamide withdrawal syndrome is characterized by a decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after flutamide withdrawal in a subset of patients with progressing metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. It is generally hypothesized to be due to a point mutation in the androgen receptor that allows the antiandrogen to function as an agonist, leading to a dramatic and rapid PSA response. We describe a patient with androgen-independent prostate cancer in whom PSA continued to decrease for a period of 15 months after flutamide withdrawal. With continuing fall in PSA, the patient had unequivocal progression of disease seen on bone scan. This case illustrates the potential decoupling of PSA response from disease status in flutamide withdrawal. It also illustrates the need for continued clinical evaluation of patients with metastatic prostate cancer, even in the face of PSA response.",1998,6
1595,9642842,Anaphylactic reaction to oral prednisone: a case report and review of the literature.,Reports of corticosteroid anaphylactic reactions are rare in the medical literature. We describe the case of a nonatopic 17-year-old girl with bronchial asthma and aspirin intolerance who developed a dramatic anaphylactic reaction to oral prednisone. She recovered with shock therapy and intravenous administration of diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone. Intradermal testing with a wide range of steroid preparations gave positive results to prednisone. No reactions occurred to methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone. This case and the brief review of the literature which follows emphasize the danger of prednisone administration in patients who have asthma and a history of drug intolerance.,0,0
1596,9647315,Persistent loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra after neuroleptic withdrawal.,"A 37 year woman developed neuroleptic induced parkinsonism that persisted long after the drug had been discontinued. This prompted a study of the effect of an eight week course of haloperidol (HAL) followed by two week withdrawal, on dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra in rats. Animals treated with HAL showed a highly significant 32%-46% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra, and 20% contraction of the TH stained dendritic arbour. Neuroleptic drug induced downregulation of nigral dopaminergic neurons may help to explain the persistent parkinsonism found in many patients after withdrawal of medication.",1998,6
1597,9651465,Desensitization to pancreatic enzyme intolerance in a child with cystic fibrosis.,"Pancreatic enzyme is essential in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), but intolerance to it occasionally occurs. We encountered a child who was intolerant to multiple commercially available preparations of pancreatic enzymes and, hence, desensitization was attempted, with success.
A 33-month-old girl was diagnosed with CF at 6 months of age. Initially, she was started on Pancrease MT 16, which was subsequently discontinued because fecal fat studies were normal and she seemed to do well on Nutramigen and vitamin supplements. At 29 months of age, she developed diarrhea with bulky stools and weight loss. A fecal fat 72-hour study revealed a coefficient of absorption of 50%. She was treated with Pancrease MT 16, but had consistent vomiting 1 to 2 hours after administration of enzymes. The vomiting occurred on switching to different pancreatic enzymes preparations, ie, Creon 10, Viokase, and Pancrease MT 16. Vomiting occurred even with small doses of enzymes disguised in food. She had no history suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer, or pork allergy, and no vomiting on days when enzymes were not given. This was suggestive of type I hypersensitivity reaction. Pancreatic enzymes were discontinued, and she was given a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet with satisfactory weight gain.
Double-blind, placebo-controlled titrated oral challenges with pancreatic enzymes resulted in definite vomiting within 1 to 1.5 hours after challenges with Viokase and Pancrease MT 16, but not with placebo. Rush oral desensitization with Viokase solution was attempted, starting with 5 mg, and the dose was doubled every 20 minutes, aiming to reach a cumulative dose of 700 mg. However, the child vomited when a cumulative dose of 315 mg was reached. Another trial of slower desensitization was done using Pancrease MT 16 (1 capsule: 16 000 U of lipase, 48 000 U of amylase, and 48 000 U of protease), starting with 1/4 capsule per day, with increments of 1/4 capsule every 3 days, until an entire capsule was reached by day 10, then increased by approximately 1/2 capsule every 4 days until reaching the therapeutic dose of 1 capsule with each meal by day 25.
The patient tolerated this fairly well and has been on this treatment and regular diet for >1 year, without any adverse reaction. This illustrates a rare case of gastrointestinal adverse reaction to pancreatic enzymes that was treated successfully with desensitization.
Pancreatic enzyme intolerance, although rare, would be a major problem in the management of patients with CF. Hence, desensitization would be essential and may be accomplished successfully using the protocol described in this report.",1998,7
1598,9655664,Acute valproate ingestion induces symptomatic methemoglobinemia.,"A wide variety of clinical outcomes have been described after acute valproate ingestion. We report for the first time the development of symptomatic methemoglobinemia after an acute ingestion of divalproex sodium (Depakote), resulting in serum concentrations 10 times greater than the therapeutic range. The methemoglobinemia was readily reversed with the administration of methylene blue. Valproate elimination was enhanced by the continuous infusion of activated charcoal. The patient recovered without permanent sequelae.",1998,6

Treatment possibilities of this multisystem disease up to now remain disappointing. We report a case of MMC-related hemolytic uremic syndrome, and discuss the etiologic parameters, clinical aspects, prognosis and treatment modalities of this severe syndrome.",1998,6
1600,9671138,Severe respiratory syncytial virus pulmonary infection in a patient treated with fludarabine for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"Fludarabine phosphate is currently proposed for the treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CD4 T-lymphocyte depletion, myelosuppression, and subsequent severe infections are the major side effects of fludarabine phosphate therapy. We report here on a heretofore undescribed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in a patient with a long-standing history of refractory CLL that was treated with fludarabine phosphate. The patient developed a severe infection of the upper and lower respiratory tract with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and severe hypoxemia. RSV was the only infectious agent that could be isolated, and treatment with aerosolized ribavirin lead to prompt improvement of all symptoms.",1998,5

In this article, four patient reports of a specific interaction--the serotonin syndrome--are presented. These events resulted from transitioning headache patients from an older antidepressant (phenelzine) to a newer antidepressant (venlafaxine).",1998,7
1602,9681211,Leukaemoid monocytosis in M4 AML following chemotherapy and G-CSF.,We describe a patient with M4 AML treated with standard chemotherapy followed by G-CSF who developed marked monocytosis on day 8 of G-CSF therapy. Fourteen days after discontinuation of G-CSF therapy his monocyte counts returned to normal levels and a marrow aspirate showed a reduction in blast cells. He received further chemotherapy without G-CSF and without any recurrence of the raised leucocyte count but failed to achieve full remission. Although this G-CSF-driven leucocytosis was alarming it did not appear to have adversely affected the patient's prognosis.,1998,2
1603,968449,Chromosome abnormalities after chlorambucil therapy of polycythaemia vera.,"Bone marrow chromosomes were studied in 2 patients with polycythaemia vera (PV) at the time of diagnosis and several times subsequently during therapy with chlorambucil. Both patients were normal in the initial study, but later developed pathological diploid cell lines with structural chromosome abnormalities. Case 1 presented after 25 months of myelosuppressive therapy a deletion of chromosome no. 12, del (12) (p11), in 60% of the diploid cells. 10 months later all studied cells in the marrow contained this deletion. In addition, the deletion of chromosome no. 20, described as characteristic for PV, was found in 3 cells. Case 2 demonstrated after 40 months on chlorambucil the presence of a balanced translocation, t (1;5) (p36;q31) in 90% of the cells. In none of the patients were any definite clinical, laboratory or morphological signs of an approaching leukaemic transformation of the polycythaemic disorder present.",1976,9
1604,9695308,Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive crescentic glomerulonephritis associated with propylthiouracil therapy.,A teenage girl with crescentic glomerulonephritis had antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) detected after she had received propylthiouracil (PTU) for hyperthyroidism without cutaneous vasculitis. ANCA was detected on admission; renal biopsy showed crescentic glomerulonephritis with focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis but no immune deposits. Administration of steroid and decreasing the dose of PTU produced a good clinical response and the ANCA disappeared. It was concluded that ANCA is closely related to the pathogenesis of crescentic glomerulonephritis and that treatment with PTU appeared to induce ANCA.,1998,6
1605,9701106,A drug interaction between zafirlukast and theophylline.,"The apparent low adverse effect profile of the new drug zafirlukast has made it an attractive choice in the treatment of asthma. We present the first case (to our knowledge) of a potentially serious drug-drug interaction between zafirlukast and theophylline. A 15-year-old white girl with asthma had been taking theophylline (Slo-bid, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals Inc, Collegeville, Pa) (300 mg twice daily), with drug levels of approximately 61 micromol/L (11.0 microg/mL) for several years. Recently, her serum theophylline levels had increased to the toxic range (133.2 micromol/L [24 microg/mL]) shortly after the addition of zafirlukast (Accolate, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, Del) to her regimen. Attempts were made to stop and then restart the theophylline therapy at progressively lower doses; however, with each attempt, the patient's reaction to the drug became more toxic, with serum theophylline levels ranging between 99.9 and 149.9 micromol/L (18 and 27 microg/mL). So this potential drug-drug interaction could be investigated, the patient stopped taking both drugs for 1 week. Then, she again started taking theophylline (75 mg twice daily), and over 2 days reached a steady state serum theophylline level of 12.8 to 14.4 micromol/L (2.3-2.6 microg/mL). On the third day, zafirlukast (20 mg twice daily) was reintroduced to the regimen, and the theophylline therapy was continued. By the fifth day, a dramatic 7-fold increase was seen in the serum theophylline level (101.6 micromol/L [18.3 microg/mL]). The areas under the curve for theophylline alone and theophylline with zafirlukast were 29.3 and 197 (mg x h)/L, respectively. One explanation for the noted increase in the theophylline level is that metabolism occurs mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP 1A2), an enzyme that is known to be inhibited with high concentrations of zafirlukast. Although the current metabolism of the 2 drugs in combination is poorly understood, the potential for serious interactions seems to exist in the rapidly growing population of persons with asthma, for whom they may be prescribed. The noted increase in the theophylline level after zafirlukast administration is in contrast to the original reports by the manufacturer. Therefore, we recommend that physicians evaluate serum theophylline levels closely when prescribing the 2 drugs in combination.",0,0
1606,9704170,Rhabdomyolysis associated with clozapine treatment in a patient with decreased calcium-dependent potassium permeability of cell membranes.,"A 21-year-old patient developed rhabdomyolysis during his nineteenth week of treatment with clozapine for drug-resistant schizophrenia. No risk factors for rhabdomyolysis were found, but the calcium-dependent potassium efflux, normally responsible for membrane hyperpolarization and muscle refractoriness, was severely decreased in the patient's red blood cells. Clozapine is speculated to cause rhabdomyolysis in patients with defective calcium-activated K+ channels.",0,0
1607,9709726,Risk of abuse of diphenhydramine in children and adolescents with chronic illnesses.,"Diphenhydramine is generally considered an innocuous drug with a minimal risk for abuse and untoward side effects. We describe children and adolescents with chronic hematologic and oncologic diseases who exhibited drug-seeking behavior or anticholinergic symptoms with the use of diphenhydramine. These cases illustrate that the assumption that this drugs is without significant adverse effects may be unwarranted, especially for children and adolescents with chronic diseases.",1998,8
1608,9719245,Pancytopenia associated with 5-aminosalicylic acid use in a patient with Crohn's disease.,"We report a case of pancytopenia in a 23-year-old man with Crohn's disease who was treated with 5-aminosalicylic acid (Pentasa; Nisshin, Tokyo, Japan) 3.0 g/day. He developed fever, nausea, diarrhea, and malaise and stopped taking on the third day after commencing Pentasa. Ten days after withdrawal of Pentasa, he was admitted to hospital because of worsening symptoms. Hematologic evaluation disclosed pancytopenia: red blood cells 283 x 10(4)/mm3; white blood cells 700/mm3; and platelets 8000/mm3. Other pertinent laboratory data, including liver and renal function tests results, serology for virus infection, and serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acids, were normal. Bone marrow examination showed a generalized hypocellular picture, suggestive of drug-induced bone marrow suppression. He received blood transfusion and recombinant human granulocyte colong-stimulating factor (filgrastim). The leucopenia and thrombocytopenia resolved on the 7th and 13th days of hospitalization, respectively. The anemia continued because of bloody stool caused by Crohn's disease. However, reticulocytes were markedly increased in number on the 13th day of hospitalization. He is well at 9 months follow-up. Excluding other causes, Pentasa-associated pancytopenia was considered. The increasing use of this agent is expected, because of the increasing number of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Careful clinical and hematological monitoring should be performed, especially for the first 3 months, in patients beginning treatment with Pentasa. The drug should be withdrawn immediately if there is a suspicion of blood disorders.",1998,8
1609,9723127,Decreased plasma cortisol level during alprazolam treatment of panic disorder: a case report.,"1. Changes in the plasma cortisol level were reported in a male patient with panic disorder during the period of low-dose alprazolam treatment (mean 0.62 +/- 0.15 mg/day) compared with during the period of high-dose period (mean 1.08 +/- 0.28 mg/day). 2. The plasma cortisol level was significantly higher in the low-dose period (mean 13.90 +/- 3.35 micrograms/ml) than in the high-dose period (mean 9.06 +/- 2.75 micrograms/ml) although, paradoxically, the panic attack frequency was significantly lower in the low-dose period (mean 1.35 +/- 0.29/day) than in the high-dose period (mean 2.09 +/- 0.66/day). 3. Thus, the decreased plasma cortisol level during alprazolam treatment of panic disorder was suggested to be caused not by symptom alleviation due to alprazolam but by alprazolam administration itself.",1998,7
1610,9725786,Nocardial brain abscess in a renal transplant recipient successfully treated with triple antimicrobials.,"Nocardia is a serious opportunistic infection in renal transplant recipients and nocardial brain abscess in these patients has a high mortality. In addition to antimicrobial therapy, treatment usually involves craniotomy and excision of the abscess. We describe a renal transplant recipient maintained on cyclosporine and prednisone developing Nocardia Asteroides brain abscess. After stereotactic aspiration of the abscess, successful treatment was achieved by triple therapy with trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), ceftriaxone and amikacin. The allograft function remained stable. Long-term prophylaxis with TMP/SMX is necessary to prevent the relapse of nocardia.",1998,8
1611,9733234,Monitoring and predicting ototoxic damage using distortion-product otoacoustic emissions: pediatric case study.,"Young children undergoing cisplatin chemotherapy are known to be at risk for progressive sensorineural hearing loss. Early detection of such hearing loss is important for providing management options. However, in ill and/or young children, behavioral audiometry may not be sufficiently precise to detect the early stages of hearing loss. This case illustrates that distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) may be an appropriate cross-check measure to supplement and confirm pediatric behavioral data. Perhaps more importantly, this study suggests that DPOAEs may have the potential to predict the earliest stages of progressive hearing loss before such changes are seen in audiometric thresholds.",1998,8
1612,9737132,Pentazocine-induced fibrous myopathy and localized neuropathy.,"A 47 year-old woman who had a 4-year history of intramuscular pentazocine injections in the lower extremities, developed gradual stiffness and weakness of the lower extremities. The thigh and buttock muscles were ""wooden-hard"" on palpation. The skin was hard, shiny and hairless. Associated clinical and electrophysiological polyradiculopathy and multiple mononeuropathy of the lower extremities were observed. Imaging studies showed calcification and fibrosis of the involved muscles. Muscle biopsy revealed fibrous myopathy. Caution in longterm usage and early recognition of pentazocine toxicity as a neuromuscular complication are important in order to prevent irreversible drug-induced fibrous myopathy and localized neuropathy.",1998,9
1613,9754850,Severe akathisia during olanzapine treatment of acute schizophrenia.,"Olanzapine is a newly developed atypical neuroleptic with a marked affinity to the 5-HT2, D2 and D4 dopamine receptors. Like other atypical neuroleptics olanzapine is considered to show a reduced prevalence of extrapyramidal side effects when compared to classical neuroleptic drugs. We report on three patients with acute schizophrenia, who developed severe akathisia during treatment with olanzapine (20-25 mg/d). In two of these cases akathisia resolved after withdrawal of olanzapine and substitution by a classical or an atypical neuroleptic agent, respectively. In one of these patients olanzapine was well tolerated when reintroduced in combination with lorazepam after complete remission of akathisia. In the third patient akathisia was sufficiently controlled by dose reduction. Akathisia is generally considered to result from D2 dopamine receptor antagonism. In the case of atypical neuroleptics such as olanzapine a low but still considerable D2 dopamine receptor occupancy may be compensated by the 5-HT2 antagonism. However, this mechanism may fail under certain circumstances, in particular if D2 dopamine antagonism exceeds a certain threshold. One should therefore be aware of possible extrapyramidal side effects with olanzapine that are reduced compared to classical neuroleptic drugs but not completely eliminated.",1998,7
1614,9758325,Seizures in patients receiving concomitant antimuscarinics and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.,"Seizures occurred in two patients with probable Alzheimer's disease who were receiving long-term treatment with metrifonate, an irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. In both patients seizures were associated with discontinuation of short-term agents with high antimuscarinic properties. Hence, abrupt discontinuation of antimuscarinics or anticholinergics with high antimuscarinic properties in patients receiving long-term acetylcholinesterase inhibition therapy may be associated with a reduction of seizure threshold. With increasing administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for patients with Alzheimer's disease, practitioners should be aware of the potential for drug-drug interactions and other complications. In general, it is good medical practice to avoid concomitant administration with centrally acting anticholinergic agents.",0,0
1615,9760614,Treatment of total hyphema with relatively low-dose tissue plasminogen activator.,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in the treatment of total hyphema following ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. Three patients (3 eyes) representing unresolved total hyphema for more than 5 days and uncontrolled high intraocular pressure received intracameral injections of 10 microgram of recombinant tPA. Intracameral tPA injection resulted in complete resolution of hyphema in all 3 eyes. Resolution occurred mostly within 24 to 48 hours after injection. Possible side effects of tPA injection, such as increased intraocular pressure and corneal edema, were not observed. However, 1 eye had vitreous hemorrhage after repeated injections of tPA. Intracameral injection of tPA seems to be a safe and effective method for the treatment of unresolved total hyphema. However, repeated intracameral tPA injections may cause unwanted complications such as vitreous hemorrhage.",1998,9
1616,9770151,Human coenurosis in North America: case reports and review.,"Coenurosis is a zoonotic disease of humans caused by the larval stage of Taenia (Multiceps) species. In North America, the adult tapeworm of Taenia (Multiceps) serialis is found in canids. The cystic larval forms (coenuri) are found in hares, rabbits, squirrels, and, rarely, in humans. We review in clinical detail the fifth case reported from North America, involving a child with extensive central nervous system involvement. We also report a sixth case, involving an adult with an intramuscular coenurus. The latter case was diagnosed by needle aspiration of the cyst. Although praziquantel administration may have been effective in killing the parasite in both patients, we are concerned about the production of marked inflammation as a result of treatment. The four other North American cases are reviewed, and the epidemiology of the infection in animals is discussed.",1998,9
1617,9776099,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in a burn patient.,"A 39 year old white male with a 55% total body surface burn who developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) during his acute course is reported. The patient had several acute sinusitis and septic episodes during his acute course. On postburn day 31, he developed a temperature of 108.4 degrees F (42.4 degrees C). This responded promptly to Dantrolene and Bromocriptene. His recovery was uneventful. NMS is a drug-related response to various medications, such as Haloperidol, which the patient was receiving. NMS must be considered as part of the differential diagnosis of fever in burn patients receiving medication known to cause the syndrome.",1998,9
1618,9777751,Methimazole-induced aplastic anemia in third exposure: successful treatment with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.,"The major adverse reactions of antithyroid drugs are hematologic; aplastic anemia (AA) is one of the rarest and most severe complications. Use of recombinant human hemopoietic colony-stimulating factor was reported to be of benefit in patients who developed agranulocytosis, although there is still some doubt regarding the efficacy in AA. We present a case of a 58-year-old female patient with Graves' disease who developed AA in the third exposure to methimazole (MMI). The withdrawal of MMI and early treatment with 5 microg/kg per day recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for 9 days, allowed a favorable recovery of peripheral blood cell count. We conclude that the use of hemopoietic colony stimulating factors might be a suitable means to achieve the correction of severe thionamide-induced hematologic adverse reactions.",1998,9
1619,9787325,Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia: case reports and review of literature.,"To report the occurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), discuss pathogenesis and problems in management.
Progressive renal dysfunction developed in two adolescent black girls with high-risk ALL who underwent renal biopsies that were consistent with FSGS. In both patients, no known etiologic factors, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, sickle cell anemia, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, were evident. FSGS induced by Adriamycin (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Columbus, OH) has been observed experimentally in rats. The patients had received anthracyclines and methotrexate, a known nephrotoxic chemotherapeutic agent.
One patient progressed to chronic renal failure and required prolonged dialysis followed by renal transplantation, though the leukemia remained in remission. The other patient is also in remission and on maintenance treatment for leukemia. She has persistent proteinuria and is currently undergoing a trial of high-dose steroid therapy.
The combination of FSGS with leukemia poses a management challenge to the clinician in terms of further treatment with potentially nephrotoxic drugs, complications of nephrotic syndrome (including infections), and timing of renal transplantation. Future studies should address whether FSGS represents a glomerular response to anthracycline-induced injury in susceptible black persons.",0,0
1620,9792602,Tubulointerstitial nephritis induced by the leukotriene receptor antagonist pranlukast.,"A 7-year-old boy with asthma was receiving the leukotriene receptor antagonist pranlukast (Ultair; SmithKline Beecham; Pittsburgh) as part of an open-label clinical trial. The patient's asthma improved, and he remained asymptomatic; but routine study evaluations 9 to 12 months into therapy showed microhematuria, proteinuria, glucosuria, anemia, and renal insufficiency. Renal biopsy demonstrated changes classic for acute allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN), with mixed interstitial inflammatory infiltrate including eosinophils. Within 6 months of pranlukast withdrawal, anemia resolved and urinary sediment and renal function normalized. The case demonstrates that hypersensitivity reaction to pranlukast and resultant ATIN is possible, and that periodic urine testing in patients receiving pranlukast should be considered.",1998,10
1621,9796135,Syncope in a 65-year-old woman after nitrate ingestion.,"A 65-year-old woman with angina pectoris presented with syncope after sublingual ingestion of isosorbide dinitrate (5 mg). Her response to a postural challenge test, without medication, was normal. In a postural challenge test after administration of isosorbide dinitrate (5 mg), blood pressure decreased from 120/67 to 65/35 mmHg, followed by syncope with a sudden decrease in pulse rate from 85 to 60 beats/min. No evidence of myocardial infarction was detected. Elderly patients for whom nitrate has been prescribed should be warned of the occurrence of hypotension, leading to unconsciousness.",1998,9
1622,9804082,Three diabetic cases of acute dizziness due to initial administration of voglibose.,"We observed 3 diabetic patients with intolerable dizziness followed by nausea and vomiting immediately after an initial administration of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, voglibose. These symptoms did not recur after discontinuation of the drug. Adverse effects as observed in these cases have not been reported previously. Since the 3 patients were relatively old (average age, 72 years old) and had various degrees of micro- and macroangiopathies, these side effects may have been associated with increased micro- and macrocirculatory disturbances in their central nervous systems through alpha-glucosidase inhibition of this agent.",1998,9
1623,9819544,Naproxen-associated sudden sensorineural hearing loss.,"Naproxen is a commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) whose side effects include tinnitus and transient hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss has rarely been reported as a result of NSAID use. This usually occurs in patients taking other ototoxic medications, with poor renal function, or with autoimmune disease. This article reports the case of an otherwise healthy patient who experienced permanent sensorineural hearing loss after a brief course of naproxen and reviews the literature on NSAID-related permanent sensorineural hearing loss.",1998,11
1624,9824032,Dental and gingival pain as side effects of niacin therapy.,"Two 65-year-old white men with coronary heart disease, given niacin therapy for dyslipidemia for 5 months, developed intense dental and gingival pain that was associated with increases in dose and that was relieved with discontinuance of niacin treatment. One individual who took crystalline niacin had beneficial effects on lipid levels, while the other person who took a delayed release preparation had little lipid effect. The cause of these previously unreported side effects of niacin therapy is uncertain but may be related to prostaglandin-mediated vasodilatation, hyperalgesia of sensory nerve receptors, and potentiation of inflammation in the gingiva with referral of pain to the teeth.",1998,11
1625,9831311,High-dose phosphate treatment leads to hypokalemia in hypophosphatemic osteomalacia.,"The mechanism of the decrease in plasma potassium induced by phosphate treatment was investigated in a 24-year-old hypertensive patient with hypophosphatemic osteomalacia, who was the youngest of four patients, belonging to a 23 number kindred of five generations. Parameters of potassium, sodium, calcium, and phosphate metabolism as well as specific renal functions have been studied in the basal state and during administration of graded doses of phosphate (500-6000 mg). Progressive hypokalemia developed during phosphate treatment. An inverse correlation was found between plasma potassium and doses of phosphate (plasma potassium = -0.2 g phosphate + 3.9 r = -0.49; p < 0.05; N = 21). A renal route of potassium loss was suspected, but could not be confirmed as potassium excretion did not increase although sodium excretion was augmented [basal sodium output: 56.7 mmol/24 h; phosphate treatment: 153 mmol/24 h (p < 0.05)]. Transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) also decreased and an inverse correlation was found between TTKG and doses of phosphate (r = -0.37; p < 0.02; N = 38). Decrease of TTKG was possibly the result of suppressed K+ secretion. It was concluded that potassium loss occurred by a non-renal (intestinal) route in phosphate-induced hypokalemia. Although major hazards of treatment of hypophosphatemic osteomalacia with phosphate and calcitriol are secondary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D intoxication, potassium loss also should be kept in mind.",1998,0
1626,9840249,"Alveolar-interstitial pneumopathy after gold-salts compounds administration, requiring mechanical ventilation.","The pulmonary toxicity of gold salts is an uncommon cause of life-threatening respiratory failure. Currently, patients who suffer from this do not need mechanical ventilation, and the toxicity can be difficult to diagnose when it occurs in patient with an illness producing pulmonary manifestations. We report a case of severe respiratory failure due to gold salt toxicity in a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis requiring mechanical ventilation. At such a time, the poor respiratory function makes some diagnostic procedures harmful. The diagnosis can be made after the exclusion of other causes of rheumatoid lung when the patient's poor respiratory status precludes invasive exploration. The clinical findings, radiological features, and results of pulmonary function tests may be enough to diagnose gold-related pneumopathy. This avoids the need for bronchoscopic examination or transfer of the patient for computed tomography. Attention must be paid to this complication because the outcome and functional prognosis are better when pulmonary involvement is gold related: in our case steroid therapy was life-saving and induced complete recovery of the lung damage.",1998,10
1627,9847899,Exacerbation of the inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis after antiretroviral therapy.,"A patient with HIV infection was successfully treated for pulmonary tuberculosis, but pulmonary inflammation and lymphadenitis worsened dramatically after subsequent combination antiretroviral therapy. As this relapse coincided with development of a strong delayed-type hypersensitivity response to tuberculin and improved after treatment with the anti-inflammatory agent oxpentifylline, it was probably caused by restoration of pathogen-specific cellular immunity.",1998,11
1628,984862,Induction of glycosuria and hyperglycemia by topical corticosteroid therapy.,"A patient with psoriasis is described who had an abnormal response to the glucose tolerance test without other evidence of diabetes and then developed postprandial hyperglycemia and glycosuria during a period of topical administration of a corticosteroid cream, halcinonide cream 0.1%, under occlusion. A second patient with a similar glucose tolerance test result showed postprandial hyperglycemia when treated similarly with betamethasone valerate cream 0.1%. Two additional patients with midly abnormal responses to glucose tolerance tests showed no evidence of altered glucose metabolism when treated with halcinonide cream in a similar manner.",1976,11
1629,9855339,Interaction between tacrolimus and nefazodone in a stable renal transplant recipient.,"Tacrolimus (FK-506) is an important immunosuppressive agent most often given for maintenance immunosuppression to prevent acute cellular organ rejection. A 57-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease presumed secondary to chronic glomerulonephritis underwent a living related renal allograft transplantation. She tolerated the surgery well and was discharged on postoperative day 5. She was stabilized with prednisone, azathioprine, and tacrolimus. Two years after transplantation, nefazodone 50 mg twice/day orally was prescribed due to depression. After 1 week of nefazodone therapy the patient experienced headache, confusion, and ""gray areas"" in her vision, without abnormal ophthalmologic findings. Her serum creatinine was elevated to 2.2 mg/dl (baseline 1.5 mg/dl), and trough tacrolimus level was markedly elevated (> 30 ng/ml). Both tacrolimus and nefazodone are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 system. We suspect that nefazodone inhibits metabolism of tacrolimus. Coadministration of antidepressant agents such as nefazodone, or any other drug that inhibits the CYP3A4 isoenzyme subfamily, should be anticipated to interfere with tacrolimus metabolism. Monitoring blood concentrations of tacrolimus is vital, and appropriate dosage adjustments are required when the two drugs are administered concurrently to avoid serious interactions such as nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity.",0,0
1630,9861579,Non-fatal mirtazapine overdose.,We report the case of intoxication of a 41-year-old female patient suffering from major depression with mirtazapine complicated by severe hypothermia. The patient was brought to an intensive care unit 10 hours after intake of 1200 mg mirtazapine and 20 mg lorazepam and laying outside at outdoor temperatures below 0 degree C. The mirtazapine plasma-level was 368 ng/ml still after 41 hours. Body temperature was reduced to 26 degrees C and rhabdomyolysis due to hypothermia was observed. Cardial and respiratory function was compromised and intubation was necessary. The patient recovered without persisting somatic impairment.,1998,11
1631,9865241,The use of pamidronate for hypercalcemia secondary to acute vitamin D intoxication.,"Pamidronate disodium, a bone resorption inhibitor through osteoclast mediation, has been used to treat chronic hypercalcemia secondary to malignancy and chronic renal failure. We report the use of pamidronate for acute, severe hypercalcemia secondary to iatrogenic vitamin D poisoning.
A 77-year-old female nursing home resident was inadvertently administered 50,000 units of oral vitamin D daily for 6 days. The patient presented with lethargy, abdominal pain, and vomiting. The patient's initial serum calcium concentration was 5.25 mmol/L (21 mg/dL). The patient was initially treated with hydration and furosemide but developed congestive heart failure. Pamidronate was used and calcium concentrations normalized by 24 hours after treatment.
We report a case of the use of pamidronate for significant hypercalcemia secondary to acute vitamin D poisoning. Although evidence of congestive heart failure was evident, dialysis was avoided without significant sequelae. Pamidronate therapy should be considered in patients with hypercalcemia secondary to acute vitamin D poisoning.",1998,0

1633,9876812,Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone associated with vinorelbine therapy.,"To describe onset of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) associated with vinorelbine therapy for advanced breast cancer.
A 50-year-old white woman with a history of advanced breast cancer refractory to other treatment modalities was receiving vinorelbine. Blood chemistries revealed severely depleted sodium and potassium concentrations from a normal baseline within a 7-day period. A recheck of blood chemistries confirmed hyponatremia. The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated for SIADH. After successful treatment, she was given demeclocycline prophylactically and rechallenged with vinorelbine without recurrence of the syndrome.
SIADH has been reported as a complication of treatment with vinca alkaloids. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this syndrome related to vinorelbine therapy.
Because of its structural similarity to the other vinca alkaloids, vinorelbine is believed to be responsible for SIADH in our patient. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility that vinorelbine may cause SIADH and possibly hypokalemia.",1998,12
1634,9883483,Pirmenol hydrochloride-induced QT prolongation and T wave inversion on electrocardiogram during treatment for symptomatic atrial fibrillation.,"Pirmenol hydrochloride is a new orally effective, long-acting antiarrhythmic agent currently used in patients with supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. We report on a 56-year-old female who exhibited drug refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, in which marked prolongation of the QT interval and T wave inversion on electrocardiogram was demonstrated reproducibly shortly after the administration of oral pirmenol therapy. The plasma concentration of pirmenol was at a subtherapeutic level and the lymphocyte stimulation test was positive in this patient. Thus, an immunological mechanism might be involved in the mechanism of pirmenol-induced QT prolongation and T wave inversion on the electrocardiogram.",1998,12
1635,9886213,Disseminated muscular cysticercosis with myositis induced by praziquantel therapy.,"Cysticercosis, the infestation with the encysted larval stage of Taenia solium, is increasingly recognized as a major problem in most countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, involving mainly the central nervous system. Muscle involvement is also common, although it usually remains asymptomatic. We describe a case of disseminated muscular cysticercosis followed by myositis (fever, diffuse myalgia, weakness of the lower limbs, and inflammatory reaction around dying cysticerci) induced by praziquantel therapy, an event not described previously.",1998,12
1636,9892272,Massive subfascial hematoma after alteplase therapy for acute myocardial infarction.,The authors report a case of a patient who received alteplase for acute myocardial infarction and developed spontaneous subfascial hematoma without any evidence of direct trauma. Subfascial hematoma remains a rare and self-limited complication of thrombolytic therapy. The development of cutaneous ecchymosis associated with a sudden fall in hemoglobin after the administration of alteplase should strongly suggest the possibility of diffuse subfascial hematoma. Physicians should be aware of the possible association between the use of alteplase and the development of subfascial hemorrhage.,1999,1

1638,9920368,Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis associated with thyrotropin receptor antibody.,"Since amiodarone was first marketed in 1992 in Japan, the incidence of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) has been increasing. Among 12 thyrotoxic patients, a patient with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, who had been taking amiodarone for 4 years, developed thyrotoxicosis with subacute onset, accompanied by transiently positive thyrotropin (TSH) receptor antibody (TRAb), or thyrotropin-binding inhibiting immunoglobulin (TBII). The immunoglobulin G (IgG) obtained from the TRAb-positive serum of the patient elicited no thyroid hormone-releasing activity in cultured human thyroid follicles, whereas all IgGs obtained from untreated Graves' disease elicited positive results. These in vitro findings and clinical course suggest that TRAb/TBII without thyroid-stimulating activity may develop in patients with amiodarone-induced destructive thyroiditis, as reported in patients with destructive thyroiditis, such as subacute and silent thyroiditis.",1998,12
1639,9925865,Lipoid pneumonia: a silent complication of mineral oil aspiration.,"Chronic constipation is a common symptom in pediatrics, and physicians often use mineral oil to treat chronic constipation in children. Mineral oil, a hydrocarbon, may not elicit a normal protective cough reflex and may impair mucociliary transport. These effects can increase the likelihood of its aspiration and subsequent impaired clearance from the respiratory tract. We report a case of a child with neurodevelopmental delay with chronic constipation and a history of chronic mineral oil ingestion presenting as asymptomatic exogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP).
A 6-year-old white boy with a history of developmental delay was found to have an infiltrate in his right upper lobe on a chest radiograph obtained during evaluation for thoracic scoliosis. The patient had a long history of constipation with daily use of mineral oil. He was fed by mouth and had occasional episodes of coughing and choking during feeding. He was asymptomatic at presentation and physical examination was unremarkable. The patient was advised to stop administration of the mineral oil and was treated empirically with antibiotics during a 3-month period. At follow-up examination the patient continued to be asymptomatic, with the radiologic persistence of the infiltrate. Diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia was made by diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The exogenous origin of the lipid in the BAL fluid was confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
The clinical presentation of ELP is nonspecific and ranges from the totally asymptomatic patient with incidental radiologic finding, like our patient, to the patient with acute or chronic symptoms attributable to pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, or cor pulmonale. Bronchoscopy with BAL can be successful in establishing the diagnosis of ELP by demonstration of a high lipid-laden macrophage index. Treatment of ELP in children is generally supportive, with the symptoms and roentgenographic abnormalities resolving within months after stopping the use of mineral oil.
Lipoid pneumonia as a result of mineral oil aspiration still occurs in the pediatric population. It can mimic other diseases because of its nonspecific clinical presentation and radiographic signs. In patients with swallowing dysfunction and pneumonia, a history of mineral oil use should be obtained and a diagnosis of ELP should be considered in the differential diagnoses if mineral oil use has occurred. Our case points to the need for increased awareness by the general pediatricians of the potential hazards of mineral oil use for chronic constipation.",1999,2
1640,9934637,An unusual cause of burn injury: unsupervised use of drugs that contain psoralens.,"Although psoralens are useful components of the psoralen ultraviolet A-range therapy that is mainly used for the treatment of vitiligo, psoriasis, and hypopigmented scars, they have a narrow margin of safety. Oral and topical forms of psoralen-containing drugs are routinely used in medicine. Because psoralens sensitize skin to ultraviolet A light, phototoxic reactions are the most frequent adverse effect of this treatment. Sunburn may sometimes be a major injury in psoralen users because high doses or inappropriate use of the drug may render the skin extremely sensitive. In this article, we present the case of a vitiligo patient who was admitted to our facility with an intense burn after the topical use of 8-methoxypsoralen solution as a suntanning agent. We will also discuss the unusual nature of this type of burn and the course of phototoxic lesions and their differences from a typical sunburn.",0,0

A 72-year-old white man was admitted for worsening palpable purpura over a two-day period. Two days prior to admission, metoclopramide 10 mg orally three times per day was started for a gastrointestinal condition. Upon admission, all drugs were continued except metoclopramide. Over the next two days, the purpura began to resolve. Platelet count was within normal limits on admission and the patient developed no serious consequences because of the purpura.
According to the literature, reversible nonthrombocytopenic palpable purpura has not been previously reported with metoclopramide. A search of MEDLINE (1966 to November 1998) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to November 1998) did not reveal a similar case. Although a rechallenge was not tried, this case appears to demonstrate a temporal relationship between the initiation and discontinuation of metoclopramide and the onset and resolution of symptoms. Similar cases of this reaction have been reported with procainamide, which is structurally similar to metoclopramide.
Metoclopramide may cause reversible nonthrombocytopenic vascular-type palpable purpura. Discontinuation of the drug appeared to be responsible for the resolution of symptoms.",1999,1
1642,998323,Lithium treatment of a patient with periodic catatonia.,"This case report describes successful lithium treatment in a patient with long-standing periodic catatonia. Various medical treatments had been tried with meager results. Since 1955, a number of phenothiazines had been tried, also with little improvement. The institution of lithium treatment in 1964 caused a dramatic improvement in the patient's condition. For 9 years the patient remained totally asymptomatic. Lithium treatment was terminated in 1975 because of lithium intoxication with a diabetes insipidus-like syndrome. The patient then became psychotic again and has since experienced periodic phases similar to the previous illness. The diagnostic validity of the case is discussed, and some possible explanations of the favourable response to lithium are mentioned briefly.",1976,10

There have been few reports, however, which have investigated a challenge with clozapine in patients previously showing eosinophilia. Two case reports are presented: the first with clozapine challenge after eosinophilia, the second under clozapine treatment and no previous haematological side effects. The challenge case showed eosinophilia with 1.2 10(9)/l (z = 1.79, p = 0.04) being followed by normalization despite clozapine continuation, whereas the maximum value reached 2.1 10(9)/l in the single episode case, with consecutive normalization and uninterrupted treatment. Eosinophilia caused by clozapine was observed in challenge, preceded by a faster neutrophil production and consecutive decrease (z = 2.27, p = 0.01). A challenge with clozapine was feasible and showed no clinical symptoms of eosinophilia.",1998,1
